\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\noindent 
This document describes in detail an inventory of 50~semantic labels 
designed to characterize the use of adpositions and case markers 
at a somewhat coarse level of granularity. 
Version~2 is a revision of the supersense inventory proposed for English by 
\citet{schneider-15,schneider-16} and documented in PrepWiki\footnote{\url{http://tiny.cc/prepwiki}} 
(henceforth ``v1''), which in turn was based on previous schemes.
The present inventory was developed after extensive review of the 
v1 corpus annotations for English, 
plus previously unanalyzed \p{'s} (genitive case) possessives \citep{blodgett-18},
as well as consideration of adposition 
and case phenomena in Hebrew, Hindi, and Korean. 
\Citet{hwang-17} and \citet{hwang-18}\ present the theoretical underpinnings of the v2 scheme.
Though the v2~inventory aspires to be universal, this document is specific to English; 
documentation for other languages will be published separately.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}

\nss{v1 is documented in PrepWiki (\url{http://tiny.cc/prepwiki}).
v2 will be documented in Xposition (URL TBD).}

\subsection{What counts as an adposition?}

``Adposition'' is the cover term for prepositions and postpositions. 
Briefly, we consider an affix, word, or multiword expression to be an adposition if it:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mediates a semantically asymmetric figure--ground relation between two concepts
  \item Is a grammatical item that can mark an NP, and in some cases may mark clauses (as a subordinator) 
  or be intransitive. 
  We also include always-intransitive grammatical items whose core meaning is spatial and highly schematic, 
  like English \p{together}, \p{apart}, and \p{away}.
  \item Is not a differential object marker (e.g., Hebrew \p{'et}, which marks direct objects if and only if 
  they are definite).
\end{itemize}
\ab{differential object markers are ignored because they don't have any lexical semantic content, is that the criterion?}

\nss{What about a word that matches the above criteria where it is used as an intransitive 
predicate, e.g. \pex{She is \p{out}/\p{away}}?}\ab{I think that is an adverbial usage instead of adpositional.}

\subsection{Inventory}

The v2 hierarchy is a tree with 50~labels.
They are organized into three major subhierarchies: 
\psst{Circumstance} (18~labels), \psst{Participant} (14~labels), 
and \psst{Configuration} (18~labels).

\subsection{Limitations}

This inventory is only designed to capture semantic relations 
with a figure--ground asymmetry. This excludes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The semantics of coordination, where the two sides of the relation 
are on equal footing, is not captured here. (Note that sometimes a morpheme can 
have symmetric as well as asymmetric interpretations: e.g., Korean \p{-wa}.)
  \item Aspects of meaning that pertain to information structure, discourse, 
or pragmatics.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, this inventory only captures semantic distinctions 
that tend to correlate with major differences in syntactic distribution. 
Thus, while there are labels for locative (\psst{Locus}), ablative (\psst{Source}), 
allative (\psst{Goal}), and \psst{Path} semantics---and analogous temporal categories---%
finer-grained details of spatiotemporal meaning are for the most part lexical 
(viz.: the difference between \pex{\p{in} the box} and \pex{\p{on} the box}, 
or temporal \p{at}, \p{before}, \p{during}, and \p{after}) and are not represented here.\ab{how does this relate to semantic distinctions correlating with syntactic distribution?}\footnote{This is not to claim
that all members of a category can be grammatical in all the same contexts: 
\pex{\p{on} Saturday} and \pex{\p{at} 5:00} are both labeled \psst{Time}, 
though the prepositions are by no means interchangeable in American English. 
We are simply asserting that the different constructions specific to days of the week 
versus times of the day are minor aspects of the grammar of English.}

\subsection{Major changes from v1}

Changes that affect only a single label are explained below the relevant 
v2 labels.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Removed multiple inheritance.} 
  The v1 network was quite tangled. The structure is greatly simplified 
  by analyzing some tokens as \emph{construals} \citep{hwang-17}.
  \item \textbf{Revised and expanded the \psst{Configuration} subhierarchy.}
  \item \textbf{Removed the locative concreteness distinction.}
  In v1, labels \sst{Location}, \sst{InitialLocation}, and \sst{Destination} 
  were reserved for concrete locations, and the respective supertypes 
  \sst{Locus}, \sst{Source}, and \sst{Goal} used to cover abstract locations.
  This distinction was found to be difficult and without apparent
  relevance to the English preposition system.\ab{probably also because we did not find it relevant for the other three languages we applied the hierarchy to!}\ab{although I'm thinking for many of these changes- is the hierarchy supposed to be English-focused?} The concrete labels were thus removed.
  \item \textbf{Removed the location/state/value distinction.}
  The v1 scheme attempted to make an elaborate distinction between 
  values, states, and other kinds of abstract locations. 
  However, the English preposition system does not seem particularly 
  sensitive to these distinctions. (We are not aware of any prepositions 
  that mark primarily values or primarily states; rather, productive 
  metaphors allow locative prepositions to be extended to cover these, 
  and there are cases where teasing apart abstract location vs.~state vs.~value 
  is difficult.) Therefore, \sst{State}, \sst{StartState}, \sst{EndState}, 
  \sst{Value}, and \sst{ValueComparison} were removed.\footnote{\nss{In v1, 10 tokens of \sst{StartState} and 20 of \sst{EndState}, mostly involving values on a scale, now merged with \psst{Source} and \psst{Goal}, resp.}}
  \item \textbf{Revised the treatment of comparison and related notions.} 
  \nss{\sst{Comparison/Contrast}, \sst{Scalar/Rank}, \sst{ValueComparison}; 
  moved \psst{Approximator} under \psst{Quantity}}
  \item \textbf{Greatly simplified the \psst{Path} subhierarchy.} See \cref{sec:Path}.
  \item \textbf{Simplified the \psst{Temporal} subhierarchy.} See \cref{sec:Temporal}.
  \item \nss{removed \sst{Activity}, \sst{Material}, \sst{Reciprocation}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Major changes from earlier versions of this document}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Since the \textbf{April 7, 2017} version:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Broadened and clarified \sst{DeicticTime}, moved it up a level in the hierarchy, 
      and renamed it to \psst{Interval}. Clarified the distinction between \psst{Interval} and \psst{Duration}.
    \item Clarified \psst{Locus}, \psst{Source}, \psst{Goal}, \psst{Path}, and 
      \psst{Direction}, especially with regard to (i)~intransitive prepositions, 
      (ii)~distance measurements, and (iii)~inherent parts.
    \item Significantly expanded the scope of \psst{Manner} to cover states of entities and depictives.
    \item Clarified \p{like} as \psst{ComparisonRef} with regard to categories and sets, 
    and \psst{Part/Portion} with regard to elements and exceptions.
    \item Clarified \p{with} in regard to \psst{Topic} and \psst{Stimulus}.
    \item Extensively clarified \psst{Purpose} and \psst{Beneficiary}, 
    and their relationship to \psst{ComparisonRef}, \psst{Recipient}, \psst{Experiencer}, and \psst{Stimulus}.
    \item Clarified that goods and services are \psst{Theme}; expanded on \psst{Co-Theme} examples.
    \item \psst{Frequency} used for an iteration.
    \item Various selectional verbs and miscellaneous constructions.
    \item Added examples of \p{'s} possessive/genitive marking, and added ``case'' to the title.
    \item Added discussion of special syntactic constructions (\cref{sec:cxns}): Reflexive PP idioms.
    \item Added special labels (\cref{sec:special}).
    \item Added an index of adpositions and supersenses.
    \item Revised the title and abstract.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hierAdef{Circumstance}

\shortdef{Macrolabel for labels pertaining to space and time; 
abstract\slash metaphoric locations such as states;
and other categories that usually constitute semantically non-core properties of events.}

\psst{Circumstance} is used directly for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Contextualization}
\begin{exe}
    \ex \p*{In}{in} arguing for tax reform, the president claimed that loopholes allow 
    big corporations to profit from moving their headquarters overseas.
    \ex\label{ex:in-activity-Circumstance} 
      You crossed the line \p{in} sharing confidential information.\\{} 
      [but see \cref{ex:in-activity-Topic} under \psst{Topic}, which is syntactically parallel]
    \ex Bipartisan compromise is unlikely \p{with} the election just around the corner.
  \end{exe}
  For these cases, the preposition helps situate 
  the background context in which the main event takes place. 
  The background context is often realized as a subordinate clause 
  preceding the main clause. 
  It may also be realized as an adjective complement:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\begin{xlist}
      \ex My tutor was helpful \p{in} giving concrete examples and exercises.
      \ex You were correct \p{in} \choices{answering the question\\your answer}.
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}
  \item \textbf{Setting events}
  Similarly here, the object of the preposition is as noun denoting an containing 
  event; it thus may help establish the place, time, and/or reason for the governing scene, 
  but is not specifically providing any one of these, though a locative preposition is used:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:settingevt} We are having fun \choices{\p{at} the party\\\p{on} vacation}. (\rf{Circumstance}{Locus})
  \end{exe}
  These can be questioned (at least in some contexts) with \emph{Where?} or \emph{When?}. 
  \Cref{ex:settingevt} entails \cref{ex:settingevtpred}:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:settingevtpred} We are \choices{\p{at} the party\\\p{on} vacation}. (\rf{Circumstance}{Locus})
  \end{exe}
  which may be responsive to the questions \emph{Where are you?} and \emph{What are you doing?}.\footnote{When 
  the object of the preposition is not a (dynamic) event, as with \pex{We are \p{at} odds/\p{on} medication}, 
  \rf{Manner}{Locus} is used: see discussion of state PPs at \psst{Manner}.}
  
  \item \textbf{Occasions}
  \begin{exe}
    \ex I bought her a bike \p{for} Christmas.
    \ex I had peanut butter \p{for} lunch.
  \end{exe}
  These simultaneously express a \psst{Time} and some element of causality 
  similar to \psst{Purpose}.
  But the PP is not exactly answering a \pex{Why?}\ or \pex{When?}\ question. 
  Instead, the sentence most naturally answers a question like \pex{On what occasion was X done?}
  or \pex{Under what circumstances did X happen?}.
  \item Any other descriptions of event/state properties that are \textbf{insufficiently specified} 
  to fall under spatial, temporal, causal, or other subtypes like \psst{Manner}. E.g.:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:over-lunch} Let's discuss the matter \p{over} lunch. [compare \cref{ex:at-lunch}]
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\hierBdef{Temporal}

\shortdef{Abstract supercategory for temporal descriptions: 
\textbf{when}, \textbf{for how long}, \textbf{how often}, \textbf{how many times}, 
etc.\ something happened or will happen.}

\begin{history}
  The v1 category \sst{Age} (e.g., \pex{a child \p{of} five}) 
  was a mutual subtype of \psst{Temporal} and \sst{Attribute}. 
  Being quite specific and rare, for v2 it was merged with \psst{Characteristic}. 
  Combined with the changes to \psst{Time} subcategories (see below), 
  this reduced by~3 the number of labels in the \psst{Temporal} subtree, 
  bringing it to 7.
\end{history}

\hierCdef{Time}

\shortdef{\textbf{When} something happened or will happen, in relation to an 
explicit or implicit reference time or event.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex We ate \choices{\p{in} the afternoon\\\p{at} 2:00\\\p{on} Friday}.
  \ex\label{ex:at-lunch} Let's talk \choices{\p{at}\\\p{during}} lunch. [compare \cref{ex:over-lunch}]
  \ex They will greet us \choices{\p{on}\\\p{upon}} our arrival.
  \ex I will finish \p{after} \choices{tomorrow\\lunch\\you (do)}.
  \ex I will finish \p{by} \choices{tomorrow\\lunch}.
\end{exe}

The preposition \p{since} is ambiguous:
\begin{exe}
  \ex {} [`after'] I grew a beard---that was \p{since} the breakup. (\psst{Time})
  \ex {} [`ever since'] I have loved you \p{since} the party where we met. (\psst{StartTime}) %\ab{are 9 \& 10 really different?\nss{yes, 10 cannot be paraphrased with `after'}}
  \ex {} [`because'] I'll try not to whistle \p{since} I know that gets on your nerves. (\psst{Explanation})
\end{exe}

Simple \psst{Time} is also used if the reference time is implicit and determined from 
the discourse:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We broke up last year, and I haven't seen her \p{since}. [since we broke up]
\end{exe}

However, \rf{Time}{Interval} is used for adpositions whose complement (object) 
is the amount of time between two reference points:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We left the party \p{after} an hour. [an hour after it started] (\rf{Time}{Interval})
  \ex We left the party an hour \p{ago}. [an hour before now] (\rf{Time}{Interval})
\end{exe}

\begin{history}
  In v1, point-like temporal prepositions (\p{at}, \p{on}, \p{in}, \p{as}) 
  were distinguished from displaced temporal prepositions (\p{before}, \p{after}, etc.) 
  which present the two times in the relation as unequal. 
  \sst{RelativeTime} inherited from \psst{Time} and was reserved for the 
  displaced temporal prepositions, as well as subclasses \psst{StartTime}, 
  \psst{EndTime}, \sst{DeicticTime}, and \sst{ClockTimeCxn}. 
  
  For v2, \sst{RelativeTime} was merged into \psst{Time}: the distinction 
  was found to be entirely lexical and lacked parallelism with the spatial hierarchy. 
  \sst{ClockTimeCxn} was also merged with \sst{Time}, the usages covered by the former 
  (expressions of clock time like \pex{ten \p{of} seven})
  being exceedingly rare and not very different semantically from 
  prepositions like \p{before}.
  \sst{DeicticTime} became \psst{Interval}.
\end{history}

\hierDdef{StartTime}

\shortdef{When the event denoted by the governor begins.}

Prototypical prepositions are \p{from} and \p{since} (but see note under \psst{Time} 
about the ambiguity of \p{since}):
\begin{exe}\ex\begin{xlist}
  \ex The show will run \p{from} 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
  \ex a document dating \p{from} the thirteenth century
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

Note that simple \psst{Time} is used with verbs like \w{start} and \w{begin}: 
the event directly described by the PP is the starting, not the thing that started.
\begin{exe}
  \ex The show will start \p{at} 10 a.m. (\psst{Time})
\end{exe}

\hierDdef{EndTime}

\shortdef{When the event denoted by the governor finishes.}

Prototypical prepositions are \p{to}, \p{until}, \p{till}, \p{up\_to}, and \p{through}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The show will run from 10 a.m. \p{to} 2 p.m.
  \ex Add the cider and boil \p{until} the liquid has reduced by half.
  \ex If we have survived \p{up\_to} now what is stopping us from surviving in the future?
  \ex They will be in London from March 24 \p{through} May 7.
\end{exe}

Note that simple \psst{Time} is used with verbs like \w{end} and \w{finish}: 
the event directly described by the PP is the ending, not the thing that ended.
\begin{exe}
  \ex The show will end \p{at} 2~p.m. (\psst{Time})
\end{exe}


\hierCdef{Frequency}

\shortdef{\textbf{At what rate} something happens or continues, 
or the instance of repetition that the event represents.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex Guests were arriving \p{at} a steady clip.
  \ex The risk becomes worse \p{by} the day.
\end{exe}
\psst{Frequency} is also used when an iteration is specified with an obligatory 
ordinal number modifier. 
If the ordinal number is optional, the preposition presumably receives another label:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex The camcorder failed \p{for} the third time. (\psst{Frequency})
    \ex They won \p{for} the third year in$_{\nss{?}}$ a row. (\psst{Frequency})
    \ex We arrived \p{for} our (third) visit. (\psst{Purpose})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Contrast: \psst{RateUnit}

\hierCdef{Duration}

\shortdef{Indication of \textbf{how long} an event or state lasts
(with reference to an amount of time or 
time period\slash larger event that it spans).}

\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:forDuration} I walked \choices{\p{for}\\\#\p{in}} 20~minutes.
  \ex\label{ex:GoalDuration} I walked to$_{\psst{Goal}}$ the store \choices{\p{in}/\p{within}\\\#\p{for}} 20~minutes. [see \cref{ex:inDuration}]
  \ex\label{ex:ExtentDuration} I walked a mile \choices{\p{in}/\p{within}\\\#\p{for}} 20~minutes.
  \ex\label{ex:AmbigDuration} I mowed the lawn \choices{\p{for}\\\p{in}/\p{within}} an hour.
\end{exe}
Note that the presence of a goal \cref{ex:GoalDuration} or 
extent of an event (\pex{a mile} in \cref{ex:ExtentDuration}) 
can affect the choice \psst{Duration} preposition, blocking \p{for}.
\Cref{ex:AmbigDuration} shows a direct object which can be interpreted 
either as something against which partial progress is made---licensing \p{for} 
and the inference that some of the lawn was not reached---or 
as defining the complete scope of progress, licensing \p{in}/\p{within} 
and the inference that the lawn was covered in its entirety.

The object of a \psst{Duration} preposition can also be a reference event 
or time period used as a yardstick for the extent of the main event:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:EventDuration} I walked \p{for} the entire race. [the entire time of the race]
  \ex I walked \choices{\p{throughout}\\\p{through}\\well \p{into}} the night.
\end{exe}

Some \p{for}-\psst{Duration}s measure the length of the specified event's \emph{result}:
\begin{exe}\ex \begin{xlist}
  \ex John went to the store \p{for} an hour. [he spent an hour at the store, not an hour going there]\footnote{This stands 
in contrast with \pex{John walked to the store \p{for} an hour}, where the most natural reading is that it took an hour to get to the store \citep[p.~230]{chang-98}.}
  \ex John left the party \p{for} an hour. [he spent an hour away from the party before returning]
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

A \psst{Duration} may be a stretch of time in which a simple event is repeated 
iteratively or habitually:
\begin{exe}\ex\begin{xlist}
  \ex I lifted weights \p{for} an hour. [many individual lifting acts collectively lasting an hour]
  \ex I walked to the store \p{for} a year. [over the course of a year, habitually went to the store by walking]
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

See further discussion at \psst{Interval}.

\hierCdef{Interval}

\shortdef{A marker that points retrospectively or prospectively in time, 
and if transitive, marks the time elapsed between two points in time.}

The clearest example is \p{ago}, which only serves to locate the \psst{Time}
of some past event in terms of its distance from the present:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:ago} I arrived a year \p{ago}. \rf{Time}{Interval} \\{}
  [points backwards from the present: before now]
\end{exe}
The most common use of \psst{Interval} is in the construal \rf{Time}{Interval}: 
the time of an event is described via a temporal offset from some other time.

Another retrospective marker, \p{back}, can be transitive \cref{ex:backTrans}, 
or can be an intransitive modifier 
of a \psst{Time} PP \cref{ex:backIntrans}. 
Plain \psst{Interval} is used in the latter case:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:backTrans} I arrived a year \p{back}.\footnote{While 
  \pex{a while \p{back}} and \pex{a few generations \p{back}} are generally accepted, 
  %\p{back} with smaller measurements,
  the use of \p{back} rather than \p{ago} for nearer and more precise temporal references,
  e.g.~\pex{10~minutes \p{back}}, appears to be especially associated with Indian English \citep[p.~7]{yadurajan-01}.} \rf{Time}{Interval}
  \ex\label{ex:backIntrans} I arrived \p{back} in$_{\psst{Time}}$ June. (\psst{Interval})
\end{exe}



(This category is unusual in primarily marking a construal for a different scene role. 
But this seems justified given the restrictive set of English temporal prepositions 
that can appear with a temporal offset, and the distinct ambiguity of \p{in}.
\psst{Interval} is designed as the temporal counterpart of \psst{Direction}, 
which can construe static distance measures; 
in fact, \sst{TimeDirection} was considered as a possible name, 
but \psst{Interval} seemed more straightforward for the most frequent class of usages.)

Other adpositions can also take an amount of intervening time as their \emph{complement} (object):
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:inAmbiguousTime} I will eat \p{in} 10~minutes.
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex\label{ex:inDuration} {} [`for no more than 10~minutes' reading]: \psst{Duration}\footnote{This usage of \p{in} has been classified under the terms \emph{frame adverbial} \citep{pustejovsky-91} and \emph{span adverbial} \citep{chang-98}.}
      \ex\label{ex:inInterval} {} [`10~minutes from now' reading]: \rf{Time}{Interval}\footnote{This usage of \p{in}, as well as \p{ago} \cref{ex:ago} and \p{back} \cref{ex:backTrans,ex:backIntrans},
      are \emph{deictic}, i.e., they are inherently relative to the speech time or deictic center. 
      (See also \citet[pp.~154--157]{klein-94}.)
      This was taken to be a criterion for the v1 category \sst{DeicticTime}, 
      but that was never well-defined in v1 and was broadened for this version.}
    \end{xlist}
  % \ex\begin{xlist}\nss{not sure what to do with these. remove for now}
  %   \ex What are the revenue projections 6~months \p{out}?
  %   \ex I've started watching a new TV series and am 3~episodes \p{in}.\nss{``3 episodes into the show''?}
  %\end{xlist}
  \ex\label{ex:AfterObj} The game started at 7:00, but I arrived \choices{\p{after}\\\p{within}} 20~minutes.
\end{exe}
Some adpositions license a temporal difference measure in \emph{modifier} position, which does not qualify:
\begin{exe}
  \ex To beat the crowds, I will arrive \uline{a while} \choices{\p{before} (it starts)\\\p{beforehand}}. (\psst{Time})
  \ex\label{ex:AfterMod} The game started at 7:00, but I arrived \uline{20~minutes} \choices{\p{after} (it started)\\\p{afterward}}. (\psst{Time})
\end{exe}
The preposition \p{after} can be used either way---contrast \cref{ex:AfterMod} with \cref{ex:AfterObj}.

Note that having \psst{Interval} as a separate category allows us to distinguish the sense of \p{in} 
in \cref{ex:inInterval} from both the \psst{Duration} sense \cref{ex:inDuration} 
and the \psst{Time} sense (\pex{\p{in} the morning}).

\paragraph{Versus \psst{Duration}.} 
The prepositions \p{in} and \p{within} are ambiguous between \psst{Interval} and \psst{Duration}.\footnote{By contrast, 
\p{after} seems to strongly favor \rf{Time}{Interval}. 
\pex{\p*{After}{after} a week, I had climbed all the way to the summit} is possible, 
but the conclusion that the climbing took a week may be an inference 
rather than something that is directly expressed.}
The distinction can be subtle and context-dependent.
The key test is whether the phrase answers a \emph{When?}\ question. 
If so, its scene role is \psst{Time}; otherwise, it is a \psst{Duration}.
%With a verb which refers to a punctual moment of culmination, 
%we use \psst{Interval} even though there may be an implicit 
%preparatory process with a duration:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \rf{Time}{Interval}:
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex I reached the summit \p{in} 3~days. [= 3~days later, I reached the summit.]
    \ex I was at the summit \p{within} 3~days. [= 3~days later, I was at the summit.]
    \ex I finished climbing \p{in} 3~days. [= 3~days later, I finished climbing.]
    \ex They had the engine fixed \p{in} 3~days. [= 3~days later, they had the engine fixed.]
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
  \ex \psst{Duration}:
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex I reached the summit \p{in} 3~days. [it took not more than 3~days]
      \ex I had climbed 1000 feet \p{in} [a total of] 3~days.
      \ex I fixed the engine \p{in} 3~days. [it took not more than 3~days] %\\
      %$\rightarrow$ I was fixing the engine \p{for} 3~days. (\psst{Duration})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%Though \p{for} generally marks \psst{Duration}s, it can mark an \psst{Interval} under negation:
With a negated event, we use \psst{Duration}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I haven't eaten \choices{\p{in}\\\p{for}} hours. [hours have passed since the last time I ate]
  (\choices{\#When} haven't you eaten?)
\end{exe}

% Some temporal prepositions may be intransitive \cref{ex:IntrRefTime}, 
% or may take a temporal difference measure as the object \cref{ex:TimeDiff},
% provided that a reference time is salient in the discourse. 
% With such prepositions, the reference time may default to the speech time. 
% However, we limit \psst{DeicticTime} to those prepositions 
% whose \emph{inherent} reference point is the speech time. 
% The following contexts allow a \psst{Time} but not a \psst{DeicticTime}: 
% \begin{exe}
%   %\ex\label{ex:IntrRefTime} To beat the crowds at the game, I will arrive an hour \choices{\p{before}\\\p{beforehand}\\ \#\p{ago}}. (\psst{Time})
%   \ex\label{ex:IntrRefTime} To beat the crowds at the game, I will arrive a while \choices{\p{before}\\\p{beforehand}\\\#\p{ago}\\\#\p{back}}. (\psst{Time})
%   \ex\label{ex:TimeDiff} I took a seat in the waiting room. \choices{\p{After}\\\p{Within}\\??\p{In}} 15 minutes, the doctor saw me for an hour. (\psst{Time})
% \end{exe}
% To summarize: \psst{DeicticTime} covers preposition usages where `now' is inherent,
% and the more general \psst{Time} applies if the reference time is given in the 
% direct object or depends on the discourse.

\begin{history}
  Version~1 featured a label called \sst{DeicticTime}, under \sst{RelativeTime}, 
  which was meant to cover \p{ago} and temporal usages of other adpositions 
  (such as \p{in}) whose reference point is the utterance time or deictic center. 
  This concept proved difficult to apply and was (without good justification) 
  used as a catch-all for intransitive usages of temporal prepositions. 
  For v2, the new concept of \psst{Interval} is broader in that it drops the deictic 
  requirement (also covering \p{within}), while \psst{Time} has been clarified to include 
  intransitive usages of prepositions like \p{before} where the reference time 
  can be recovered from discourse context.
\end{history}


\hierBdef{Locus}

\shortdef{Location, condition, or value. May be abstract.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex I like to sing \choices{\p{at} the gym\\\p{in} the shower\\\p{on} Main St.}.
  \ex The cat is \choices{\p{on\_top\_of}\\\p{off}\\\p{beside}\\\p{near}} the dog.
  %\ex the wheels \p{on} the bus % Whole ~> Locus
  \ex\label{ex:onRight} When you drive north, the river is \p{on} the right.
  \ex I read it \choices{\p{in} a book\\\p{on} a website}.
  \ex The charge is \p{on} my credit card.
  \ex We met \p{on} a trip to Paris.
  \ex The Dow is \p{at} \choices{a new high\\20,000}.
  \ex I am now \p{off} work.\nss{\rf{Circumstance}{Locus}?}
  \ex That's \p{in} my price range.
  \ex She was \p{in} a coma.\nss{\rf{Circumstance}{Locus}?}
\end{exe}
The \psst{Locus} may be a part of another scene argument:
part of a figure whose static orientation is described, 
or a focal part of a ground where contact with the figure occurs:\footnote{\psst{Part/Portion} 
was considered but rejected for these cases. Instead we assume the verb 
semantics would stipulate that it licenses a \psst{Theme} as well as a (core) \psst{Locus} 
which must be a part of that \psst{Theme}.}
\begin{exe}
  \ex She was lying \p{on} her back.
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex She kissed me \p{on} the cheek.
    \ex I want to punch you \p{in} the face.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Words that incorporate a kind of reference point are \psst{Locus} 
even without an overt object:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex The cat is \p{inside} the house.
    \ex The cat is \p{inside}.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex All passengers are \p{aboard} the ship.
    \ex All passengers are \p{aboard}.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\psst{Locus} also applies to \p{in}, \p{out}, \p{off}, \p{away}, \p{back}, 
etc.\ when used to describe a location without an overt object:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex The doctor is \choices{\p{in}\\\p{out\_of}\\\p{away\_from}} the office.
    \ex The doctor is \choices{\p{in}\\\p{out}\\\p{away}}.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
And to \p{around} meaning `nearby' or `in the area':
\begin{exe}
  \ex Will you be \p{around} in the afternoon?
  \ex She's the best doctor \p{around}!
\end{exe}

In a phenomenon called \textbf{fictive motion} \citep{talmy-96}, 
dynamic language may be used to describe static scenes. 
We use construal for these:
\begin{exe}
  \ex A road runs \p{through} my property. (\rf{Locus}{Path})
  \ex The road extends \p{to} the river. (\rf{Locus}{Goal})
  \ex I saw him \p{from} the roof. (\rf{Locus}{Source})
  \ex\label{ex:protesters} Protesters were \choices{kept\\missing} \p{from} the area. (\rf{Locus}{Source})
  \ex We're just \p{across} the street from$_{\text{\rf{Locus}{Source}}}$ you. (\rf{Locus}{Path})\nss{what construal for My house is across\_from yours? cf. away\_from}
\end{exe}
Construal is also used for prepositions licensed by scalar adjectives of distance, 
\cref{ex:adjDist}, and \p{to} used with a cardinal direction, \cref{ex:cardinalTo}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:adjDist} \begin{xlist}
    \ex We are quite close \p{to} the river. (\rf{Locus}{Goal})
    \ex We are quite far \p{from} the river. (\rf{Locus}{Source})
  \end{xlist}
  \ex\label{ex:cardinalTo} The river is \p{to} the north. (\rf{Locus}{Goal}) [cf.~\cref{ex:onRight}]
\end{exe}
See also \rf{Locus}{Direction} for static distance measurements, 
described under \psst{Direction}.

\hierCdef{Source}

\shortdef{Initial location, condition, or value. May be abstract.}

For motion events, the initial location is where the thing in motion 
(the figure) starts out.
\psst{Source} also applies to abstract or metaphoric initial locations, 
including initial states in a dynamic event.
%and simple \psst{Source} is used for adpositions that generically mark starting points.

In English, a prototypical \psst{Source} preposition is \p{from}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:catBox} The cat jumped \choices{\p{from}\\\p{out\_of}} the box.
  \ex\label{ex:catLedge} The cat jumped \choices{\p{from}\\\p{off\_of}\\\p{off}} the ledge.
  \ex\label{ex:internet} I got it \choices{\p{from}\\\p{off}} the internet.
  \ex people \p{from} France
  \ex The temperature is rising \p{from} a low of 30 degrees.
  \ex I have arrived \p{from} work.
  \ex I made it \p{out\_of} clay. [material]\nss{OK?}
  \ex\label{ex:coma} She \choices{awoke \p{from}\\came \p{out\_of}} a coma.\nss{TODO: revisit}
  \ex We are moving \p{off\_of} that strategy.
\end{exe}
The \psst{Source} use of \p{from} can combine with a specific locative PP:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I took the cat \p{from} behind$_{\psst{Locus}}$ the couch.
\end{exe}
Note that \p{away\_from} is ambiguous between marking a starting point (\psst{Source}) 
and a separate orientational reference point (\psst{Direction}):
\begin{exe}
  \ex At the sound of the gun, the sprinters ran \choices{\p{away\_from}\\\p{from}} the starting line. (\psst{Source})
  \ex The bikers ride parallel to the river for several miles, then 
  head east, \choices{\p{away\_from}\\\#\p{from}} the river. 
  (\psst{Direction}: bikers are never at the river)
\end{exe}
%
%Other prepositions specify more information about the nature of the figure's 
%position and trajectory vis-\`{a}-vis its initial location: 
%e.g., \p{off} and \p{off\_of} for motion away from the top of a surface, 
%and \p{out\_of} for motion through the boundary of a container. 
%We say this involves construal of a \psst{Source} as a \psst{Direction}:
% \begin{exe}
%   \exp{ex:catBox} The cat jumped \p{out\_of} the box. (\rf{Source}{Direction})
%   \exp{ex:catLedge} The cat jumped  the ledge. (\rf{Source}{Direction})
% \end{exe}
% \nss{possible objection: we don't distinguish \p{at} (generic \psst{Locus}) 
% vs. \p{on} and \p{in} (surface and container, resp.). So why distinguish their \psst{Source} counterparts?}
%
% If figurative motion language is entrenched and bleached such that the 
% image of a specific kind of motion is no longer salient, simple \psst{Source} is used. 
% The construal as \psst{Direction} is maintained only if the figurative path
% is somewhat salient:
%
Note, too, that \p{off(\_of)} and \p{out(\_of)} can also mark simple states:\nss{TODO: revisit}
\begin{exe}
  \ex I am \p{off} \choices{medications\\work}. (\psst{Locus})
  \ex The lights are \choices{\p{off}\\\p{out}}. (\psst{Locus})
  \ex We are \p{out\_of} toilet paper. (\psst{Locus})\nss{\rf{Possession}{Source}?}
\end{exe}

Sometimes a specific \psst{Source} is implicit, and the preposition is intransitive. 
But if no specific referent is implied, another label may be more appropriate:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The cat was sitting on the ledge, then jumped \p{off}. (\psst{Source}: implicit `(of) it')
  \ex He was offered the deal, but walked \p{away}. (\psst{Source}: implicit `from it')
  \ex The bird flew \choices{\p{away}\\\p{off}}. (\psst{Direction}: vaguely away from the viewpoint)
\end{exe}

\psst{Source} is prototypically inanimate, 
though it can be used to construe animate \psst{Participant}s 
(especially \psst{Originator} and \psst{Causer}).
Contrasts with \psst{Goal}.

\paragraph{Agency as giving.}
When an \psst{Agent}'s action to help somebody is conceptualized as 
giving, and the nominalized action as the thing given, 
then \p{from} can mark the \psst{Agent} (metaphorical giver).
If the \p{from}-PP is adnominal, \rf{Agent}{Source} is used \cref{ex:AgentSource}.
However, if the \p{from}-PP is adverbial, and the verb relates to the metaphoric 
transfer rather than the event described by the action nominal, 
then the argument linking becomes too complicated for this scheme to express; 
simple \psst{Source} is used by default \cref{ex:AgentiveSource}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:AgentSource} The attention \p{from} the staff made us feel welcome. (\rf{Agent}{Source})
  \ex\label{ex:AgentiveSource}\psst{Source}:\begin{xlist} 
    \ex I received great care \p{from} this doctor.
    \ex I got a second chance \p{from} her.
    \ex I need a favor \p{from} you.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\hierCdef{Goal}

\shortdef{Final location (destination), condition, or value. May be abstract.}

Prototypical prepositions include \p{to}, \p{into}, and \p{onto}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I ran \p{to} the store.
  \ex The cat jumped \p{onto} the ledge.
  %\ex a blow/bullet \p{to} the head. (\psst{Goal}? Theme ~> Goal for 'blow'?)
  \ex I touched my ear \p{to} the floor.
  \ex She sank \p{to} her knees.
  \ex Add vanilla extract \p{to} the mix.
  \ex Everyone contributed \p{to} the meeting.
  \ex The temperature is rising \p{to} a high of 40 degrees.
  \ex We have access \p{to} the library's extensive collections.
  \ex She slipped \p{into} a coma.\nss{\rf{Circumstance}{Goal}?}
  \ex \textbf{Result} \citep[p.~1224]{cgel}: \begin{xlist}
    \ex We arrived at the airport only \p{to} discover that our flight had been canceled.
    \ex May you live \p{to} be 100!
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
For motion events, a \psst{Goal} must have been reached if the event 
has progressed to completion (was not interrupted).
\psst{Direction} is used instead for \p{toward(s)} and \p{for}, 
which mark an intended destination that is not necessarily reached:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex I headed \p{to} work. (\psst{Goal})
    \ex I headed \choices{\p{towards}\\\p{for}\\\#\p{to}} work but never made it there. (\psst{Direction})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

% \paragraph{\emph{refer to} RESOURCE.}
% When \emph{refer to} means `mention' or `use a term for' \nss{TODO}
% When \emph{refer to} means `consult' or `advise to consult' a source of information such as a book,
% it is considered a multiword verbal expression (because the \p{to} cannot be omitted in adverbial questions\nss{Is it relevant that \emph{there} can be substituted?}), 
% so the \p{to} is not labeled with a supersense:
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex I referred\_to the dictionary. (\#Why did you refer?)
%   \ex I was referred\_to the dictionary. (\#Why were you referred?)
% \end{exe}
% When it means `make a referral', i.e.~`direct somebody to a business or service-provider', 
% and \p{to} marks the suggested business or service-provider, it is labeled \psst{Goal}.
% However, when \p{to} marks the recommendation-seeker, it is labeled \psst{Recipient}{Goal}:
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex\begin{xlist}
%     \ex I needed a hairdresser, so my friend referred me \p{to} \choices{Natasha\\Hair Inc.}. (\psst{Goal})
%     \ex I am a great hairdresser---please refer me \p{to} your friends! (\rf{Recipient}{Goal})
% \end{exe}

\paragraph{\emph{go to}.} A conventional way to express one's status as a student at some school is 
with the expression \pex{go \p{to} (name or kind of school)}.
Construal is used when \pex{go \p{to}} indicates student status, rather than 
(or in addition to) physical attendance:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:student} I went \p{to} (school at$_{\psst{Locus}}$) UC Berkeley. (\rf{OrgRole}{Goal})
  \exp{ex:student} I went \p{to} UC Berkeley for the football game. (\psst{Goal})
\end{exe}
Going to a business as a customer, going to an attorney as a client, 
going to a doctor as a patient, etc.\ can also convey long-term status, 
but there is considerable gray area between habitual going and 
being in a professional relationship, so we simply use \psst{Goal}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I go \p{to} Dr.~Smith for my allergies. (\psst{Goal})
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Locative as destination.}
English regularly allows canonically static locative prepositions to mark 
goals with motion verbs like \pex{put}.\ab{Again is the hierarchy supposed to be English-focused? Adpositions in some other languages, e.g., German prepositions, differentiate senses that English does not. Do we ignore those distinctions for now only because we have not applied the hierarchy to those languages or do we do it because the hierarchy is to be faithful to English?} 
We use construal to capture both the static and dynamic aspects of meaning:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\rf{Goal}{Locus}: \begin{xlist}
    \ex I put the lamp \p{next\_to} the chair.
    \ex I'll just hop \p{in} the shower.
    \ex I put my CV \p{on} the internet.
    \ex The cat jumped \p{on} my face.
    \ex The box fell \p{on} its side.
    \ex We arrived \p{at} the airport.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

% Examined COCA first 100 results for "for London" and "for Paris".
% 'leave' is the dominant verb
%leave/flee/depart/embark/take off/set out/set sail/... for, board a plane for; head/make for; bound for; train/bus for

\psst{Goal} is prototypically inanimate, though it can be used to construe animate \psst{Participant}s 
(especially \psst{Recipient}).
Contrasts with \psst{Source}.

\hierBdef{Path}

\shortdef{The ground that must be covered in order for the motion to be complete.}

The ground covered is often a linear extent with or without 
specific starting and ending points:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The bird flew \p{over} the building.
  \ex The sun traveled \p{across} the sky.
  \ex Hot water is running \p{through} the pipes.
\end{exe}

It can also be a waypoint\slash something that must be passed or encircled. 
\begin{exe}
  \ex We flew to Rome \p{via} Paris.
  \ex I go \p{by} that coffee shop every morning.
  \ex The earth has completed another orbit \p{around} the sun.
\end{exe}
If this is a portal in the boundary of a container, 
it is often construed as \psst{Source}, \psst{Goal}, or \psst{Locus}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The bird flew \p{in} the window. (\rf{Path}{Locus})
  \ex The bird flew \p{out} the window. (\rf{Path}{Source})
  \ex A cool breeze blew \p{into} the window. (\rf{Path}{Goal})
\end{exe}

The prepositions \p{around} and \p{throughout} can mark a region in which motion 
that follows an aimless or complex trajectory is contained. 
%and which it roughly ``covers'' via an . 
Construal is used for these, whether or not the region is explicit:
\begin{exe}\ex \rf{Locus}{Path}:\begin{xlist}
  \ex The kids ran \p{around}.
  \ex The kids ran \choices{\p{around}\\\p{throughout}} the kitchen.
  \ex The kids ran \p{around} in the kitchen.
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

See also: \psst{Instrument}, \psst{Manner}

\begin{history}
  The v1 hierarchy distinguished many different subcategories of path descriptions. 
  The labels \sst{Traversed}, \sst{1DTrajectory}, \sst{2DArea}, \sst{3DMedium}, 
  \sst{Contour}, \sst{Via}, \sst{Transit}, and \sst{Course} have all been merged
  with \psst{Path} for v2.
\end{history}

\hierCdef{Direction}

\shortdef{How motion or an object is aimed\slash oriented.}

A \psst{Direction} expresses the orientation of a stationary figure or of a figure's motion.
Prototypical markers\footnote{Known variously as \emph{adverbs}, \emph{particles}, 
and \emph{intransitive prepositions}.}
are \p{away} and \p{back}; \p{up} and \p{down}; 
\p{off}; and \p{out},
provided that no specific \psst{Source} or \psst{Goal} is salient:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The bird flew \choices{\p{up}\\\p{out}\\\p{away}\\\p{off}}.
  \ex I walked \p{over} to where they were sitting.
  \ex The price shot \p{up}.
\end{exe}

In addition, transitive \p{toward(s)}, \p{for}, and \p{at} can 
indicate where something is aimed or directed (but see discussion at \psst{Goal}):
\begin{exe}
  \ex The camera is aimed \p{at} the subject.
  \ex The toddler kicked \p{at} the wall.
\end{exe}

See discussion of \p{away\_from} at \psst{Source}.

\paragraph{Distance.}
\rf{Locus}{Direction} is used for expressions of static distance between two points:
\begin{exe}
  \ex 
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex The mountains are 3~km \choices{\p{away}\\\p{apart}}. (\rf{Locus}{Direction})
      \ex The mountains are 3~km \p{away\_from} our house. (\rf{Locus}{Direction})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
This also applies to distances measured by \emph{travel time} (the amount of time 
is taken to be metonymic for the physical distance):
\begin{exe}
  \ex The mountains are an hour \choices{\p{away}\\\p{apart}}. (\rf{Locus}{Direction})
\end{exe}
Compare \psst{Extent}, which is the length of a path of motion or the amount of change.

\paragraph{Informal direction modifier in location description.}
\begin{exe}
  \ex They live (way) \choices{\p{out} past$_{\text{\rf{Locus}{Path}}}$ the highway.\\
    \p{over} by$_{\psst{Locus}}$ the school} (\rf{Locus}{Direction})
\end{exe}
Cf.~\cref{ex:backIntrans} at \psst{Interval}.

\hierCdef{Extent}

\shortdef{The size of a path.}

This can be the physical distance traversed or the amount of change on a scale:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We ran \p{for} miles.
  \ex The price shot up \p{by} 10\%.
\end{exe}

For static distance measurements, see \psst{Direction}.

\hierBdef{Means}

\shortdef{Secondary action or event that characterizes \textbf{how} 
the main event happens or is achieved.}

Prototypically a volitional action, though not necessarily \cref{ex:chlorophyll}. 
A volitional \psst{Means} will often modify an intended result, 
though the outcome can be unintended as well \cref{ex:oops}.
\begin{exe}
  \ex Open the door \p{by} turning the knob.
  \ex They retaliated \choices{\p{by} shooting\\\p{with} shootings}.
  \ex\label{ex:oops} The owners destroyed the company \p{by} growing it too fast.
  \ex\label{ex:chlorophyll} Chlorophyll absorbs the light \p{by} transfer of electrons.
\end{exe}

\psst{Means} is similar to \psst{Instrument}, which is used for causally supporting entities 
and is a kind of \psst{Participant}.
See also \psst{Topic}.

Contrast with \psst{Explanation}, which characterizes \textbf{why} 
something happens. I.e., an \psst{Explanation} portrays the secondary event 
as the causal \emph{instigator} of the main event, whereas \psst{Means} 
portrays it merely as a \emph{facilitator}.

\begin{history}
  In v1, \psst{Means} was a subtype of \psst{Instrument}, 
  but with the removal of multiple inheritance for v2, 
  the former was moved directly under \psst{Circumstance} 
  and the latter directly under \psst{Participant}.
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Manner}

\shortdef{The style in which an event unfolds, the form that something takes, 
or the condition that something is in.}

% FN definition of Manner under Expend_resource: 
%Any description of the intentional act which is not covered by more specific FEs, 
%including secondary effects (quietly, loudly), and general descriptions comparing events 
%(the same way). In addition, it may indicate salient characteristics of an Agent 
%that also affect the action ( deliberately, eagerly, carefully). 

\psst{Manner} is used as the scene role for several kinds of descriptors 
which typically license some sort of \pex{How?} question:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The style in which an action is performed or an event unfolds, 
  expressed adverbially (canonical use of the term ``manner''):
  \begin{exe}
    \ex He reacted \choices{\p{with} anger\\\p{in} anger\\angrily}.
%His reaction was angry; His angry reaction: also Manner, though not prepositional
\nss{He reacted out of anger would be \rf{Explanation}{Source}}
    \ex I made the decision \choices{\p{by} myself\\\p{without} anyone else\\\p{on}\_ my \_own}. [see \cref{sec:refl}]
  \end{exe}
  
  \item An adverbial \textbf{depictive} characterizing a participant of an event:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex She entered the room \choices{\p{in} a stupor\\ drunk}. (\rf{Manner}{Locus})
  \end{exe}

  \item The \textbf{form or shape} that something takes, including language of communication:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \rf{Manner}{Locus}:\begin{xlist}
      \ex The sand is \p{in} a pyramid shape.
      \ex The clothes are (sitting) \p{in} a pile.
      \ex I read the book \p{in} French.
      \ex The book is \p{in} French.
      \ex music \p{in} C major
      \ex She loves teaching, and it shows \p{in} her smile.
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}
  
  However, for the shape of motion, \psst{Manner} is the function rather than the 
  scene role:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:pathmanner} They dance \p{in} a circle. (\rf{Path}{Manner})\nss{actually I think this is just Manner. 
  The ``in a SHAPE'' cxn describes the SHAPE of the path, but does not refer to the path itself. 
  Cannot be questioned with Where?, unlike They drove along the road. (Does it have to be indefinite? They danced in the largest circle I have ever seen.)}
  \end{exe}

  
  \item The \textbf{state or condition} that something is in. 
  The PP or intransitive preposition is used (especially predicatively) 
  to describe a qualitative state or condition of something (especially an entity) 
  that is not simply a relation of location, time, possession, quantity, causation, etc.\ 
  between governor and object.
  For example:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item With the noun \pex{state}, \pex{condition}, etc.:
    
    \begin{exe}
      \ex\rf{Manner}{Locus}:\begin{xlist}
        \ex The chairs are \p{in} excellent shape.
        \ex I'm \p{in} no condition to go outside.
      \end{xlist}
    \end{exe}

    \item Bodily/medical conditions presented as applying to the governor:
    
    \begin{exe}
      \ex John is \choices{\p{on} his back\\\p{on} antibiotics\\\p{on} the ventilator\\\p{in} pain\\\p{in} a coma}. (\rf{Manner}{Locus})

%Contrast with cases where the object is presented as a partial property of the entity-denoting governor: “The girl with pain / with a cold” is Characteristic

    \item Idiomatic PPs expressing states, for example:\footnote{Often the object of the preposition 
    is determinerless (\pex{\p{in} business}) \citep{baldwin-06} 
    or has a fixed determiner (\pex{\p{in} a hurry}).}
    \begin{exe}
    \ex \pex{\p{on} fire} (contrast \pex{\p{in} the fire}), 
      \pex{\p{on} time} (contrast \pex{\p{at} the time}), 
      \pex{\p{in} trouble}, \pex{\p{in} love}, \pex{\p{in} tune}, \pex{\p{in} a hurry}, 
      \pex{\p{at} odds}, \pex{\p{out\_of} business}, \pex{\p{out\_of} control} (\rf{Manner}{Locus})
    \end{exe}
    
    \item Intransitive prepositions expressing a qualitative state (not location, time, etc.):
    \begin{exe}
      \ex\rf{Manner}{Locus}:\begin{xlist}
        \ex The lights are \p{off}.
        \ex The party tonight is \p{on}. [scheduled to happen; not canceled]
        \ex Political TV shows are \p{in}. [in fashion]
      \end{xlist}
    \end{exe}
  \end{itemize}
  
  A few observations about these state PPs are in order.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item In a reversal of the usual asymmetry between governor and adpositional object, 
  semantically, the PP defines the kind of scene that the governor participates in. 
  To an extent, this may be true of all predicative PPs, but the state PPs are often such 
  that the object of the preposition is neither an event nor a referential entity. 
  I.e., \pex{John is \p{in} a hurry} does not exactly express a relation 
  between the entities \pex{John} and \pex{a hurry}; rather, it expresses something 
  qualitative about the entity \pex{John}'s condition.
  
  \item The most idiomatic of the state PPs seem to resist questions of the form 
  \emph{What?}+NP-supercategory with a stranded preposition:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex More productive prepositional usages:\begin{xlist}
      \ex The party is \p{in} January.~$\rightarrow$ What month is the party \p{in}? [Or: When is the party?] (\psst{Time})
      \ex John is \p{on} aspirin.~$\rightarrow$ What medication is John \p{on}?\footnote{Or, colloquially, with a suspected mind-altering substance: \pex{What is John \emph{\p{on}}?!}} (\rf{Manner}{Locus})
    \end{xlist}
    \ex\label{ex:idiomPP} Less productive/more idiomatic preposition + NP combinations:\begin{xlist}
      \ex John is \p{in} \choices{a hurry\\a coma}.~$\nrightarrow$ What \_ is John \p{in}?\footnote{\pex{What condition/state is John \p{in}?} does work, but is quite vague.}  (\rf{Manner}{Locus})
      \ex John is \p{on} fire.~$\nrightarrow$ What \_ is John \p{on}? (\rf{Manner}{Locus})
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}

  \item Typically these states are binary: something is either \pex{\p{on} fire}\slash \pex{\p{on} time}, or not. 
  For some, the negation may be expressed by substituting a contrasting preposition: 
  an orchestra that is not \pex{\p{in} tune} is \pex{\p{out\_of} tune}.
  \end{enumerate}

  \paragraph{State PPs with complements.}
  The \rf{Manner}{Locus} construal is also used when there is effectively a preposition+NP+preposition  
  combination that links two arguments:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex\rf{Manner}{Locus}:\begin{xlist}
      \ex John is \p{in} love (with$_{\text{\rf{Stimulus}{Co-Theme}}}$ Mary).
      \ex That is \p{at} odds with$_{\text{\rf{ComparisonRef}{Co-Theme}}}$ our agreement.
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}

  \paragraph{Change-of-state PPs.}
  Occasionally, a PP will mark a start or end state, in which case we collapse 
  the state/location distinction, using \psst{Source} or \psst{Goal} as the scene role:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex John slipped \p{into} a coma. (\psst{Goal})
    \ex The drugs put John \p{in} a coma. (\rf{Goal}{Locus})
    \ex John came \p{out\_of} a coma. (\psst{Source})
  \end{exe}
  



    
  \end{itemize}
  
  %\ex You can use it \p{as} a hammer. (\rf{Manner}{Identity}\nss{?})

\nss{TODO: separate section about predicative PPs:}
Other highly specialized preposition usages in free combination with objects
We are out of eggs (Possession)
But: We are rolling in dough; Romney was born in(to) money/wealth; Married into money; ?We are in money
Maybe ‘wealth’ is interpreted as a state and that was extended to ‘money’/’dough’
Married into the newspaper business
The plane was on time; The plane arrived on time / in a timely fashion; The plane’s arrival was on time / timely; The plane’s on-time / timely arrival: all Manner ~> Locus. (Though the state expressed by the PP involves time, it does not directly answer a When? question, so it is not labeled Time.)
Intransitive: The lights are off
While somewhat borderline, we deem out of town as Locus as it answers a Where? question.

\paragraph{Versus \psst{Circumstance}.}
State PPs like \pex{\p{at} odds} and \pex{\p{on} medication}, which receive the 
construal \rf{Manner}{Locus}, are similar to situating events like 
\pex{\p{at} the party} and \pex{\p{on} vacation}, which are analyzed as 
\rf{Circumstance}{Locus}. What matters for the scene role is whether the object 
of the preposition is an event or not.

\paragraph{Versus \psst{Characteristic}.} 
Note that, despite the prevailing use of the term `manner' for descriptors of \emph{events}, 
\psst{Manner} and \psst{Characteristic} each cover certain descriptors of \emph{entities}.
The use of \rf{Manner}{Locus} to cover the state that an entity is in was deemed necessary 
to account for the dual function of PPs like \emph{\p{in} French} as
predicate complements (\emph{the book is \p{in} French}) and 
adverbials (\emph{read it \p{in} French}).


When an entity is being described, 
it is difficult to semantically separate \textbf{states} from \textbf{attributes}. 
We currently make the distinction based on whether there is a construal of \emph{partiality}, 
using \psst{Characteristic} for partial-attributes like possessions, attire, 
and body part conditions
(\emph{the man \p{with} a hat}; \emph{He is \p{in} a suit}; \emph{the man \p{with} an ear infection}), 
vs.~\psst{Manner} for conditions where the object of the preposition cannot be 
localized with respect to the entity 
(\emph{the man \p{with} a cold}; \emph{He is \p{in} pain}).
However, the feasibility of this distinction may be worth revisiting in the future.\nss{One possibility
to consider for v3: merge Characteristic and Manner as Quality,
and treat the partiality difference as a matter of construal with different functions.
E.g. Quality construed as State/Predicate vs. Quality construed as Component.}

\begin{history}
  In v1, \psst{Manner} was positioned as an ancestor of all 
  categories that license a \emph{How?} question, including 
  \psst{Instrument}, \psst{Means}, and \sst{Contour}, as in \cref{ex:pathmanner}. 
  This criterion was deemed too broad, so \psst{Manner} has no 
  subtypes in v2.
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Explanation}

\shortdef{Assertion of \textbf{why} something happens or is the case.}

This marks a secondary event that is asserted as the reason for the main event or state. 

\begin{exe}
\ex  I went outside \p{because\_of} the smell. %(Why did you go outside?)
\ex  The rain is \p{due\_to} a cold front. %(Why is there rain?)
\end{exe}

When a preposition like \p{after} is used and the relation is temporal as well as causal, 
construal captures the overlap. While \p{since} and \p{as} can also be temporal, 
there are tokens where they cannot be paraphrased respectively with \p{after} and \emph{when}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I joined a protest \p{after} the shameful vote in Congress. (\rf{Explanation}{Time})
  \ex Her popularity has grown \p{since} she announced a bid for president. (\rf{Explanation}{Time})
  \ex I will appoint him \choices{\p{since}\\\p{as}\\\#\p{after}\\\#when} he is most qualified for the job. (\psst{Explanation})
\end{exe}


\nss{TODO: Function}

Question test: \psst{Explanation} and its subtype \psst{Purpose} license
\pex{Why?} questions.

\hierCdef{Purpose}

\shortdef{Something that somebody wants to bring about,
asserted to be why something was done, is the case, or exists.}

Central usages of \psst{Purpose} explain the motivation behind an action.
Typically the governing event serves as a means for achieving or facilitating the \psst{Purpose}. 
Prototypical markers include \p{for} and infinitive marker \p{to}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
      \ex He rose \p{to} make a grand speech.
      \ex He rose \p{for} a grand speech.
      \ex surgery \p{to} treat a leg injury
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Something directly manipulated/affected can stand in metonymically 
for the desired event:
\begin{exe}\ex\begin{xlist}
  \ex I went to the store \p{for} eggs. [understood: `to acquire/buy eggs']
  \ex surgery \p{for} a leg injury [understood: `to treat a leg injury']
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

\noindent The following subcases serve to clarify the boundaries of \psst{Purpose}:
\begin{itemize}
\item	A desired outcome that is separate from, but typically a motivation for 
(hence subtype of \psst{Explanation}), the main event. 
It is possible to complete the main event without realizing the purpose.
\item \textbf{Inanimate} thing or event which is aided\slash facilitated\slash addressed\slash achieved\slash acquired 
as a consequence of the main event:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We hired a caterer \p{for} the party.
  \ex surgery \p{for} an ingrown toenail
  \ex Call the doctor \p{for} an appointment.
  \ex Go to the store \p{for} eggs.
\end{exe}
For \textbf{animates} who are aided or harmed as a consequence of the main event, see \psst{Beneficiary}.
\item	Something characterized as good/appropriate (or not) for some kind of use\slash activity\slash occasion 
or inanimate thing affected\slash addressed\slash etc., 
delimiting the applicability of a descriptor to that aspect of the thing:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \begin{xlist}
      \ex This place is great \p{for} ping-pong. 
      %[no commitment to evaluating the place in general]
      \ex This is a great place \p{for} ping-pong.
    \end{xlist}
  \ex This cleaner is good \p{for} hardwood floors.
  \ex This restaurant is great \p{for} dinner.
\end{exe}
\jh{I think the note you have above is important enough to expand on a little:} Note that in these sentences, there is no general commitment to providing a general evaluation of a place or an item as being good/. Rather, the adjectival is specifically used to provide evaluation of the activity specified in the purpose clause.

For \textbf{animates} used in similar constructions, see \psst{Beneficiary}.
\end{itemize}

%●	Intended use of something. “a shoulder TO cry on”, “a shoulder FOR crying on": Characteristic ~> Purpose

Question test: \psst{Explanation} and its subtype \psst{Purpose}, 
when used adverbially, license \pex{Why?} questions. 
\psst{Purpose} usually licenses an \pex{in order to} 
or \pex{for the purpose of} paraphrase.

\paragraph{Goods and services.} See discussion at \psst{Theme}.

\paragraph{Inherent purposes.}
An \emph{entity} (typically an artifact) can be modified to explicate an intended use or affordance. 
Because this can be understood as a static property of the entity---why it was created 
or what it is useful for (part of its qualia structure)---we
use the construal \rf{Characteristic}{Purpose} \jh{so the Characteristic designation speaks to the item's affordance and the Purpose to its ``static property''? Is ``static property'' a terminology in qualia structure? If not, on the surface read ``property'' sounds a lot like you are describing Characteristic, not purpose.}:
\footnote{In FrameNet 
as of v1.7, these sorts of purposes are labeled as \sst{Inherent\_purpose}. 
See, e.g., the example ``MONEY [to support yourself and your family]'' in the \textbf{Money} frame 
(\url{https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/lu/lu13361.xml?mode=annotation}).}
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:charPurp} \rf{Characteristic}{Purpose}:
  \begin{xlist}

    \ex something \p{to} eat
    \ex The noose \p{for} the prisoner was too loose. [understood: `for use on the prisoner']
%    \ex a good store \p{for} eggs [understood: `for acquiring/buying eggs']

    %\ex physical therapy \p{for} a leg injury. [understood: `treating a leg injury']
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Question test: \pex{What is this \_ for?}


\paragraph{With semantics of \textbf{necessity}, \textbf{sufficiency}, or \textbf{excess}.}
\psst{Purpose} marks the consequence enabled or prevented by some condition.
Because sufficiency and excess involve comparison in the condition, 
the scene role for the consequence is \psst{ComparisonRef}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I need another course \p{in\_order\_to} graduate. (\psst{Purpose})
  \ex I need \$20 \choices{\p{for}\\\p{to} attend} the show. (\psst{Purpose})
  \ex The dough takes an hour \p{to} rise. (\psst{Purpose})
  \ex\label{ex:tooShort} He is \choices{too short\\not tall enough} \choices{\p{for}\\\p{to} play} basketball. (\rf{ComparisonRef}{Purpose})
\end{exe}
Note that \cref{ex:tooShort} should be contrasted with:
\begin{exe}
  \ex He is short \p{for} a basketball player. (\psst{ComparisonRef})
\end{exe}

\jh{I am wondering if the discussion on ComparisonRef examples should be in the ComparisonRef section. Especially with Purpose section coming before the Comparison ref, the sentence and two/three examples you have don't really do a complete job in explaining this. Also, more explanation needs to be given too for the construction; that the pp is being licensed by the adjective, and that basketball serves as a ref point for comparison of those who are deemed sufficient/insufficient. And this would be more easily done under comparisonRef mindset. }

\paragraph{Versus \psst{Circumstance} for ritualized occasions.}
\psst{Purpose} applies to \p{for} 
when it marks a ritualized activity such as a meal or holiday/commemoration \jh {edit} for which the main event describes a preparation stage:
%ORIGINAL HERE: provided that the main event is in preparation for the observance: 
\begin{exe}
  \ex \psst{Purpose}:
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex I walked to this restaurant \p{for} dinner. [walking is not a part of dinner]
      \ex I bought food \p{for} dinner.
      \ex We saved money \p{for} our annual vacation.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
However, if the activity marked by \p{for} is interpreted as containing \jh{edit} the ritualized activity during which the main event occurs, 
then we use \psst{Circumstance}: 
\begin{exe}
  \ex \psst{Circumstance}: 
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex We ate there \p{for} dinner.
      \ex I received a new bicycle \p{for} Christmas.
      \ex I always drink eggnog \p{for} Christmas. [at and in celebration of Christmastime]
      \ex We were wearing costumes \p{for} Halloween. 
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
If in doubt, \psst{Circumstance} is broader: e.g., \emph{We went there \p{for} dinner} 
if \emph{went} is ambiguous between journeying and attending.


\begin{history}
  In v1, the usages illustrated in \cref{ex:charPurp} were assigned a separate label, 
  \sst{Function}, which inherited from both \sst{Attribute} and \sst{Purpose}.
  The ability to use construal removes the need for a separate label.

\shortdef{Second semantically core undergoer that would otherwise be labeled \psst{Theme},

Often, the \psst{Theme} and the \psst{Co-Theme} are similarly situated entities---rather than 
one being more figure-like and the other more ground-like---but the \psst{Co-Theme}

This includes concrete scenes of combination, attachment, separation, and substitution 
of two similar entities, as well as creation or transformation of one into another:

For \w{respond \p{with}} and similar, it depends whether the object is an action, 
a device facilitating communication, or some aspect of transferred information:
\begin{exe}

\shortdef{That which is perceived or experienced (bodily, perceptually, or emotionally).}

\psst{Stimulus} does not seem to have any prototypical adposition

\hierBdef{Experiencer}

\shortdef{Animate who is aware of a bodily experience, perception, emotion, or mental state.}

\psst{Experiencer} does not seem to have any prototypical adposition 
in the languages we have looked at. In English, it can be construed in several ways:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}

    \ex That was astounding \p{to} me (\rf{Experiencer}{Goal})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Less canonically, \psst{Experiencer} applies to semi-pragmatic usages meaning `from the perspective of':\footnote{Interestingly, 
many uses of \p{for} carry an information structural association of delimiting the scope of an assertion. 
\pex{\p{For} John, the party was not fun at all} makes no commitment regarding how fun the party was to others. 
\pex{This food is good \p{for}$_{\psst{Purpose}}$ dinner\slash \p{for}$_{\psst{Beneficiary}}$ folks with dietary constraints} 
and \pex{He is short \p{for}$_{\psst{ComparisonRef}}$ a basketball player} also have this property. 
As the present scheme targets semantic relations, it is not equipped to formalize pragmatic aspects of the meaning.}
\begin{exe}
  \ex \begin{xlist}
    \ex \p{For} John, the party was not fun at all. (\rf{Experiencer}{Beneficiary})
    \ex \p{For} John, there was no reason to attend. (\rf{Experiencer}{Beneficiary})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Elsewhere, the term \emph{cognizer} is sometimes used for one whose 
mental state is described.

\hierBdef{Originator}

\shortdef{Animate who is the initial possessor or creator/producer of something,
including the speaker/communicator of information. 
Excludes events where transfer/communication is not framed as unidirectional.}

A ``source'' in the broadest sense of a starting point/condition. 
Contrasts with \psst{Recipient} if there is transfer/communication.

English construals:\footnote{If we consider subject position as an \psst{Agent} construal 
and direct object position as a \psst{Theme} construal, then we can add examples like 
\pex{\uline{She} talked to her editor} (\rf{Originator}{Agent}) and 
\pex{They robbed \uline{her} of her life savings} (\rf{Originator}{Theme}).
\psst{Originator} does not apply to the subject of events like \pex{exchange} or \pex{talk/chat (with)}, 
which involve a back-and-forth between 
\psst{Agent} and \psst{Co-Agent} (or a plural \psst{Agent}).}

\paragraph{\emph{learn from.}} If the source of learning is an individual 
(or group of individuals, organization, etc.)\ who provides information, 
\rf{Originator}{Source} applies. Otherwise, it is simply \psst{Source}:

  \ex We learned a lot \p{from} that \choices{book\\experience}. (\psst{Source})

% ``negotations by the parties'' as \rf{Orignator}{Agent}; 
% and ``negotations between the parties'' as Originator \tat> Agent \tat> Whole!)}

\begin{history}
  \psst{Originator} merges v1 labels \sst{Donor/Speaker} and \sst{Creator}, 
  which were difficult to distinguish in the case of authorship.
  %(e.g., \pex{the operas \p{of} Puccini}).
  \sst{Donor/Speaker} was a subtype of \sst{InitialLocation}, which 
  inherited from \sst{Location} and \sst{Source}. 
  \sst{Creator} was a subtype of \psst{Agent}.
  Moving \psst{Originator} directly under \psst{Participant} 
  puts it in a neutral position with respect to its possible construals.
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Recipient}

\shortdef{Animate who is the (actual or intended) final possessor of a thing or message.
Excludes events where transfer/communication is not framed as unidirectional.}
A ``goal'' in the broadest sense of an ending point/condition. 
Contrasts with \psst{Originator}.

English construals:\footnote{If subject position is viewed as an \psst{Agent} construal, 
then active subject with a transfer verbs like \pex{get} or \pex{receive} is \rf{Recipient}{Agent}.
If direct object position is viewed as a \psst{Theme} construal,

  \ex news \p{for} our readers (\rf{Recipient}{Direction})
  \ex He is yelling \p{at} me to get ready! (\rf{Recipient}{Direction}\footnote{While \emph{yell \p{at}} 
often has a connotation of shouting criticism towards somebody, 
and criticism would suggest \psst{Beneficiary},
the \psst{Recipient} aspect of the meaning is more explicit and essential:
yelling from a distance at someone does not imply criticism, 
and criticism about someone who is absent is not yelling at them.})
  \ex The news was not well received \p{by} the White House. (\rf{Recipient}{Agent})
\end{exe}

\psst{Recipient} does not apply to events like \pex{exchange/talk/chat (\p{with})}, 
which involve a back-and-forth between 
\psst{Agent} and \psst{Co-Agent} (or a plural \psst{Agent} subject):
\begin{exe}
  \ex She \choices{swapped stories\\chatted} \p{with} her friends. (\psst{Co-Agent})
\end{exe}

See also: \psst{Beneficiary}

\begin{history}
  In v1, \psst{Recipient} was the counterpart to \sst{Donor/Speaker}:
  \psst{Recipient} was a subtype of \sst{Destination}, which 
  inherited from \sst{Location} and \sst{Goal}. 
  Moving \psst{Recipient} directly under \psst{Participant} 
  puts it in a neutral position with respect to its possible construals.
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Cost}

\shortdef{An amount (typically of money) that is linked to an item or service 
that it pays for\slash could pay for, or given as the amount earned or owed.} 

The governor may be an explicit commercial scenario:
\begin{exe}
  %\ex I paid/owed John \$10 for the book. %#nonprep
  \ex I \choices{bought\\sold} the book \p{for} \$10.
  \ex The book is \choices{priced\\valued} \p{at} \$10.
  \ex I got a refund \p{of} \$10.
\end{exe}
Or the \psst{Cost} may be specified as an adjunct with a non-commerical governor:
\begin{exe}
  \ex You can ride the bus \p{for} \choices{free\\\$1}.
\end{exe}
\psst{Cost} is \emph{not} used with general scenes of possession or transfer, 
even if the thing possessed or transferred happens to be an amount of money:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I bestowed the winner \p{with} \$100. (\psst{Co-Theme})
\end{exe}

\begin{history}
  This category was not present in v1, which had the broader category \sst{Value}. 
  VerbNet \citep{verbnet,palmer-17} has a similar category called \sst{Asset}; we chose the name 
  \psst{Cost} to emphasize that it describes a relation rather than an entity type 
  (it does not apply to money with a verb like \pex{possess} or \pex{transfer}, 
  for instance).
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Beneficiary}

\shortdef{Animate or personified undergoer that is (potentially) 
advantaged or disadvantaged by the event or state.}

This label does not distinguish the polarity of the relation 
(helping or hurting, which is sometimes termed \emph{maleficiary}).

\begin{exe}
  \ex Vote \choices{\p{for}\\\p{against}} Pedro!
  \ex These are \choices{clothes \p{for} children\\children\p{'s} clothes}.\nss{s-genitive simple Beneficiary or \rf{Beneficiary}{Possessor}?}
  \ex Junk food is bad \p{for} your health.
  \ex My parrot died \p{on} me.
\end{exe}

\noindent Specific subclasses include:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Animate who will potentially experience a benefit or harm as a result of something 
but is not an experiencer or recipient of the main predicate itself. 
(May be an experiencer or recipient of the result.)
\item	Animate target of emotion or behavior, discussed below. %(rude TO women, compassion FOR animals)
\item	Animate who someone supports or opposes (e.g., \emph{vote \p{for}}, 
\emph{cheer \p{for}}, \emph{Hooray \p{for}}). % but "Well done TO John" is Recipient ~> Goal)
\item Intended user/usee: 
  \begin{exe}
    \ex (We sell) clothes \p{for} children
    \ex a gallows \p{for} criminals
    \ex This is the car \p{for} you! [advertising idiom]
  \end{exe}
\item	Something characterized as good/appropriate (or not) for some kind of 
\textbf{animate user or usee}, delimiting the applicability of a descriptor 
to that kind of individual: 
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
      \ex This place is great \p{for} young children.
      \ex This is a great place \p{for} young children.
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}
The first and last items above have analogues with \psst{Purpose}. 
The key difference is that \psst{Beneficiary} applies to an animate participant, 
whereas \psst{Purpose} applies to an intended consequence or one of its inanimate participants.

\paragraph{Targets of behavior versus emotion.}
A preposition can mark an individual in the context of evaluating how someone else is treating them, 
with a noun or adjective governor. 
If behavior is more salient than emotion, then \psst{Beneficiary} is the scene role. 
If emotion is highly salient, then \psst{Stimulus} is the scene role.
\begin{exe}
  \ex Behavior-focused:
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex She exhibits rudeness \p{towards} customers. (\psst{Beneficiary})
      \ex He is \choices{rude\\condescending} \p{to} women. (\rf{Beneficiary}{Goal})
      \ex He is gentle and compassionate \p{with} animals. (\rf{Beneficiary}{Theme})
    \end{xlist}
  \ex Emotion-focused, repeated from \cref{ex:StimBen}:
    \begin{xlist} % Also seems to be a metaphorical connection to Direction, but that would require multiple construal to express.
      \ex Her disdain \p{for} customers was apparent. (\rf{Stimulus}{Beneficiary})
      \ex He has/feels compassion \choices{\p{towards}\\\p{for}} animals. (\rf{Stimulus}{Beneficiary})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Note that the emotion-focused examples can describe private emotional states directly, 
while the behavior-focused examples are behavior-based judgments or inferences about emotional states.

An obligation directed at somebody is analyzed like targeted behavior:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We have a solemn responsibility \p{to} our armed forces. (\rf{Beneficiary}{Goal})
\end{exe}

Similar to the behavior-focused examples, inanimate causes can have the potential to positively or negatively
affect somebody. Ability and permission modalities are included here:
\begin{exe}
    \ex\begin{xlist}
      \ex The strategy is \choices{beneficial \\ risky \\ an option} \p{for} investors. (\psst{Beneficiary})
      \ex The strategy \choices{is helpful \\ poses a risk \\ is available} \p{to} investors. (\rf{Beneficiary}{Goal})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Versus \psst{Recipient}.}
\psst{Beneficiary} applies to the classic English benefactive construction 
where it is ambiguous between assistance and intended-transfer:
\begin{exe}
  \ex John baked a cake \p{for} Mary. [to help Mary out, and/or with the intention of giving her the cake]
\end{exe}
However, if transfer (or communication) is the main semantics of the scene 
and benefit or harm is no more than an inference, then the scene role is \psst{Recipient}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex a \choices{message\\gift} \p{for} my mother (\rf{Recipient}{Direction})
  \ex a \choices{package} \p{for} the front office (\rf{Recipient}{Direction})
\end{exe}

\hierBdef{Instrument}

\shortdef{An entity that facilitates an action by applying intermediate causal force.}

Prototypically, an \psst{Agent} intentionally applies the \psst{Instrument} 
with the purpose of achieving a result:
\begin{exe}\ex\begin{xlist}
  \ex I broke the window \p{with} a hammer.
  \ex I destroyed the argument \p{with} my words.
\end{xlist}\end{exe}
Less prototypically, the action could be unintentional:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I accidentally poked myself in the eye \p{with} a stick.
\end{exe}
The key is that the \psst{Instrument} is not sufficiently ``independently causal'' 
to instigate the event.

However, to downplay the agency of the individual operating the instrument, 
the instrument can be placed in a passive \p{by}-phrase, 
which construes it as the instigator:
\begin{exe}\ex\label{ex:passiveInstrument}\begin{xlist}
  \ex The window was broken \p{by} the hammer. (\rf{Instrument}{Causer})
  \ex My headache was alleviated \p{by} aspirin. (\rf{Instrument}{Causer})
\end{xlist}\end{exe}
Note that the examples in \cref{ex:passiveInstrument} can be rephrased 
in active voice with the \psst{Instrument} as the subject.

A device serving as a mode of transportation or medium of communication 
counts as an \psst{Instrument}, but is often construed as a \psst{Locus} or \psst{Path}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Communicate \p{by} \choices{phone\\email}. (\psst{Instrument})
  \ex Talk \p{on} the phone. (\rf{Instrument}{Locus})
  \ex Send it \choices{\p{over}\\\p{via}} email. (\rf{Instrument}{Path})
  \ex Travel \p{by} train. (\psst{Instrument})
  \ex Escape \p{with} a getaway car. (\psst{Instrument})
  \ex Escape \p{in} the getaway car. (\rf{Instrument}{Locus})
\end{exe}
This includes some expressions which incorporate the \psst{Instrument} 
in a noun:
\begin{exe}
  \ex ride \p{on} horseback (\rf{Instrument}{Locus})
  \ex hold \p{at} knifepoint (\rf{Instrument}{Locus})
\end{exe}
Other non-prototypical instruments that can be construed as paths 
include waypoints from \psst{Source} to \psst{Goal}, 
and people that serve as intermediaries:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We flew to London \p{via} Paris. (\rf{Instrument}{Path})
  \ex I found out the news \p{via} Sharon. (\rf{Instrument}{Path})
\end{exe}

Conversely, roadways count as \psst{Path}s but can be construed as \psst{Instrument}s:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Escape \p{through} the tunnel. (\psst{Path})
  \ex Escape \p{by} tunnel. (\rf{Path}{Instrument})
\end{exe}

Compare \psst{Means}, which is used for facilitative events rather than entities.
See also \psst{Topic}.

\hierAdef{Configuration}

\shortdef{Thing, usually an entity or property, that is involved 
in a static relationship to some other entity.}

Not used directly---see subtypes.

\hierBdef{Identity}

\shortdef{A category being ascribed to something, 
or something belonging to the category denoted by the governor.}

Prototypical prepositions are \p{of} (where the governor is the category) 
and \p{as} (where the object is the category):
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:stateof} the state \p{of} Washington [as opposed to the city]
  \ex The liberal state \p{of} Washington has not been receptive to Trump's message.
  \ex \p*{As}{as} a liberal state, Washington has not been receptive to Trump's message.
  \ex\label{ex:ascolleague} I like Bob \p{as} a colleague. [but not as a friend]
  \ex What a gem \p{of} a restaurant! [exclamative idiom: both NPs are indefinite]
  \ex the \choices{idea\\task\\hassle} \p{of} opening a new business
  \ex\label{ex:shell} the \choices{topic\\issue} \p{of} semantics
\end{exe}
Something may be specified with a category in order to disambiguate it \cref{ex:stateof}, 
or to provide an interpretation or frame of reference with which that entity is to be considered.
In some cases, like \cref{ex:shell}, the category is a \emph{shell noun} \citep{schmid-00} 
requiring further specification.

Categorizations may be situational rather than permanent/definitional:
\begin{exe}\ex\label{ex:assituational}\begin{xlist}
  \ex She appears \p{as} Ophelia in \emph{Hamlet}.
  \ex He is usually a bartender, but today he is working \p{as} a waiter.
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

Paraphrase test: ``(thing) IS (category) [in the context of the event]'': 
``Washington is a liberal state'', ``opening a new business is a hassle'', 
``She is Ophelia'', etc. Note that \p{as}+category may attach syntactically 
to a verb, as in \cref{ex:ascolleague} and  \cref{ex:assituational}, 
rather than being governed by the item it describes.

See also: \psst{ComparisonRef}

\hierBdef{Species}

\shortdef{A category qualified by \w{sort}, \w{type}, \w{kind}, \w{species}, \w{breed}, etc. 
Includes \w{variety}, \w{selection}, \w{range}, \w{assortment}, etc.\

  \ex Modern breeds \p{of} these homing pigeons return reliably
  \ex Some poor sap applied the wrong brand \p{of} paint
  \ex This store offers a wide selection \p{of} footstools
\end{exe}

\psst{Species} is \emph{not} used if the sort/variety noun 
is the object rather than the governor:
\begin{exe}
  \ex a business \p{of} that sort (\psst{Characteristic})
\end{exe}

\hierBdef{Gestalt}

\shortdef{Generalized notion of ``whole'' understood with reference to 
a component part, possession, set member, or characteristic.

or set element. See \psst{Part/Portion}.}

      \ex\label{ex:amongSet} \p*{Among}{among} the 10 children in the class, only Mary is a redhead. (\psst{Whole})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

If the governor narrows the reference to a certain amount of the \psst{Whole}, 
the construal \rf{Quantity}{Whole} is used---see \cref{ex:QuantityWhole}. 
Note that this only applies if the governor is a measure term; 
it does not apply to distinctive parts like ``layers'' \cref{ex:layers} 
and ``prongs'' \cref{ex:prongs}, even if a count is specified.

Used to construe geographic and temporal ``containers'':
\begin{exe}
  \ex	Famous castles \p{of} the valley (\rf{Locus}{Whole})
  \ex \begin{xlist}
    \ex the \choices{15th\\Ides} \p{of} March (\rf{Time}{Whole})
    \ex March \p{of} 44~BC (\rf{Time}{Whole})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The prepositions \p{between} and \p{among} can impose \psst{Whole} construals 
by combining two or more items in the object NP (contrast with \cref{ex:amongSet}):
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:betweenParties}  The negotiations \choices{\p{between}\\\p{among}} the parties went well. (\rf{Agent}{Whole})
  \exp{ex:betweenParties} The negotiations \p{by} the parties went well. (\psst{Agent})
\end{exe}

\hierBdef{Characteristic}

\shortdef{Generalized notion of a part, feature, possession, 
or the contents or composition of something, 
understood with respect to that thing (the \psst{Gestalt}).}

Can be used to construe person-to-person relationships such as kinship, 
whose scene role should be \psst{SocialRel}. 
Labels \psst{Possession}, \psst{Part/Portion}, and its subtype \psst{Stuff} 
are defined for some important subclasses.

\psst{Characteristic} applies directly to:
\begin{itemize}
\item	A property value: 
\begin{exe} \ex \begin{xlist}
  \ex a car \p{of} high quality
  \ex a man \p{of} honor
  \ex a business \p{of} that sort [contrast with \psst{Species}, \cref{sec:Species}]
\end{xlist}\end{exe}
\item	Attire:
\begin{exe}
  \ex the kid \p{with} a vest (on)
  \ex the kid \p{in} a vest (\rf{Characteristic}{Locus})
\end{exe}
\item	Role of a complex framal \psst{Gestalt} that has no obvious decomposition into parts: 
\begin{exe}\ex \begin{xlist}
  \ex the restaurant \p{with} \choices{a convenient location\\an extensive menu}
  \ex a party \p{with} great music
\end{xlist}\end{exe}
\item	That which is located in a container denoted by the governor: 
\begin{exe}
  \ex a room \p{with} 2 beds
\end{exe}
\item With a transitive verb like \emph{search}, \emph{examine}, or \emph{test}, 
the attribute of the \psst{Theme} that is being examined:
\begin{exe}
  \ex He examined the vase \p{for} damage.
  \ex\label{ex:search-obj-for} He searched the room \p{for} his laser pistol. [contrast intransitive \psst{Theme}, \cref{ex:search-for}]
  \ex He was tested \p{for} low blood sugar.
\end{exe}
\item	Anything that is borderline between subcategories \psst{Possession} and \psstX{Part/Portion}{Part\slash Portion}
\end{itemize}

Typically, one of ``\psst{Gestalt} \{HAS, CONTAINS\} \psst{Characteristic}'' is entailed. 
This does not help to distinguish subtypes.

\begin{history}
  The v1 label \sst{Attribute} was intended to apply to features of something, 
  but was rather squishy. \nss{...}
\end{history}

\hierCdef{Possession}

\shortdef{That which some \psst{Possessor} (animate or personified, e.g.~an institution) 
\textbf{has}, and which is not part of their body or inherent to their identity/character 
but could, in principle, be taken away.}

Sometimes called \emph{alienable} possession. 
The possession may be concrete or abstract, and temporary or permanent.
Excludes attire: see \psst{Characteristic}. 

Prototypical prepositions are \p{with} and \p{without}:
\begin{exe}
\ex	People \p{with} money
\end{exe}

Immediate concrete possession uses an \psst{Accompanier} construal:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Hagrid exited the shop \p{with} (= carrying) a snowy owl. (\rf{Possessor}{Accompanier})
\end{exe}

Paraphrase test: ``\psst{Possessor} POSSESSES \psst{Possession}'', 
or ``\psst{Possessor} is IN POSSESSION OF \psst{Possession}''. 
The latter is especially appropriate for immediate concrete possession.

\hierCdef{Part/Portion}

\shortdef{A part, portion, subevent, subset, or set element (e.g., an example or exception) 
of some \psst{Whole}.}

Anything directly labeled with \psst{Part/Portion} 
is understood to be \textbf{incomplete} relative to the \psst{Whole}.
This includes body parts and partial food ingredients.

Prototypical prepositions include \p{with}, \p{without};
\p{such\_as}, \p{like} for exemplification; 
and \p{but}, \p{except}, \p{except\_for} for exceptions:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \begin{xlist}
    \ex	a car \p{with} a new engine
    \ex	a strategy \p{with} 3 prongs
    \ex	the girl \p{with} flaxen hair
    \ex	a man \p{with} a wooden leg named Smith
    \ex	a valley \p{with} a castle
    \ex	a quintet \p{with} 2 cellos
    \ex	a performance \p{with} a guitar solo
    \ex	a cake \p{with} 3 layers
    \ex	a sandwich \p{with} wheat bread
    \ex	soup \p{with} carrots (in it)
    \ex	a chicken sandwich \p{with} ketchup (on it)
  \end{xlist}
  \ex	Bread \p{without} gluten
\end{exe}
Some can be paraphrased with INCLUDES, but this is not determinative.

\paragraph{Elements and Exceptions.} 
\psst{Part/Portion} is used for adpositions marking a member or non-member of a set:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:suchAs}	strategies \p{such\_as} divide-and-conquer
  \ex Everyone \p{except} Bob plays trombone.
\end{exe}
Set-membership can be construed as comparison:
\begin{exe}
  \ex strategies \p{like} divide-and-conquer [same reading as \cref{ex:suchAs}] (\rf{Part/Portion}{ComparisonRef})
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Diverse Examples.}
In describing a set or whole, a sort of scanning with \p{from}\dots\p{to} can be used indicate diversity or coverage of 
the items/parts:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Everyone \p{from}$_{\text{\rf{Part/Portion}{Source}}}$ the peasants 
  \p{to}$_{\text{\rf{Part/Portion}{Goal}}}$ the lord and lady gathered for the feast.
\end{exe}

\hierDdef{Stuff}

\shortdef{The members comprising a group/ensemble, 
or the material comprising some unit of substance. 
\psst{Stuff} is distinguished from other instances of \psst{Part/Portion}
in fully covering (or ``summarizing'') the aggregate whole.}

Paraphrase test: ``\psst{Whole} CONSISTS OF \psst{Stuff}''

\begin{exe}
  \ex	\begin{xlist}
    \ex A flock \p{of} birds
    \ex	A throng \p{of} tourists
    \ex	A clump \p{of} sand
    \ex	A piece \p{of} wood
    \ex	A series \p{of} tennis matches
    \ex	An evening \p{of} Brahms
    \ex	A meal \p{of} salmon
  \end{xlist}
  \ex	A salad \choices{\p{of}\\\p{with}} mixed greens
  \ex\label{ex:bottleStuff} This bottle is \p{of} beer (and that one is of wine). [but see \cref{ex:bottleQuantity}]
  % \ex	\rf{Quantity}{Stuff}: see \cref{ex:QuantityStuff}
  %   \begin{xlist}
  %     \ex A bottle('s worth) \p{of} beer
  %     \ex A bag('s worth) \p{of} chips
  %   \end{xlist}
  \ex \rf{OrgRole}{Stuff}:
  	\begin{xlist}
      \ex An order \p{of} nuns
      \ex	A chamber group \choices{\p{of}\\\p{with}} 5 players
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

See also: \psst{Quantity}

\psst{Stuff} has no specific counterpart under \psst{Whole}.

\hierBdef{Accompanier}

\shortdef{Entity that another entity is together with.}

Sometimes called \emph{comitative}.

Prototypical prepositions are \p{with}, \p{without}, \p{along\_with}, 
\p{together}, \p{together\_with}, and \p{in\_addition\_to}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I'll have soup \choices{\p{with}\\\p{without}} salad.
  \ex She'll be \p{with} us in spirit.
\end{exe}

For an ``extra participant'' in an activity, 
where two parties perform the activity together 
(but the nature of the activity would not fundamentally 
change if they each performed it independently), 
a \psst{Co-Agent} construal is used:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Do you want to walk \p{with} me? (\rf{Accompanier}{Co-Agent})
\end{exe}
By contrast, if the nature of the scene fundamentally requires multiple participants, 
simple \psst{Co-Agent} is used. Often there is ambiguity:\footnote{Adding \p{together} 
seems to favor the (b)~readings: \pex{I fought \p{together\_with} them}, \pex{We fought \p{together}} 
can only mean we were on the same side. Contrastive stress can also force one reading: 
\pex{I fought \p*{WITH}{with} them (not \p*{AGAINST}{against} them)}.}
\begin{exe}
  \ex Do you want to talk \p{with} me? 
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex {}[\emph{The reading:} Should we have a conversation?] (\psst{Co-Agent})
    \ex {}[\emph{The reading:} Do you want to join me in talking to a third party?] 
      (\rf{Accompanier}{Co-Agent})
  \end{xlist}
  \ex I fought \p{with} them to reform the regulation.
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex {}[\emph{The reading:} I fought against them.] (\psst{Co-Agent})
    \ex {}[\emph{The reading:} I was on the same side as them.] (\rf{Accompanier}{Co-Agent})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

If the object denotes a item that the governor has on hand in their possession, 
then the construal \rf{Possession}{Accompanier} is used:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I walked in \p{with} an umbrella. (\rf{Possession}{Accompanier})
\end{exe}

See also: \psst{Instrument}, \psst{Manner}

\hierBdef{InsteadOf}

\shortdef{A default or already established thing for which something else stands in 
or is chosen as an alternative.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex I ordered soup \choices{\p{instead\_of}\\\p{rather\_than}} salad.
  \ex \p*{Instead\_of}{instead\_of} ordering salad, I ordered soup.
  %\ex They replaced \uline{my old tires} with new ones. %#nonprep
  \ex The new shirts were gray \p{instead\_of} black.
  \ex\label{ex:subst-for} They substituted new tires \p{for} my old ones. [replacee; contrast \cref{ex:repl-with}]
\end{exe}
May be construed spatially:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I chose soup \p{over} salad. (\rf{InsteadOf}{Locus})
\end{exe}
But when \p{over} is used for a scene of liking or preference, see \psst{ComparisonRef}.

See also: \psst{Accompanier}, \psst{ComparisonRef}, \psst{Co-Theme}

\hierBdef{ComparisonRef}

\shortdef{The reference point in an explicit comparison (or contrast), i.e., 
an expression indicating that something is 
\textbf{similar/analogous to}, \textbf{different from}, or \textbf{the same as}
something else.}

The marker of the ``something else'' (the ground in the figure–ground relationship) 
is given the label \psst{ComparisonRef}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \begin{xlist}
    \ex She is taller \p{than} me.
    \ex She is taller \p{than} I am.
    \ex She is taller \p{than} she is wide.
    \ex She is better at math \p{than} at drawing.
    \ex The shirt is more gray \p{than} black.
    %\ex She is greater in height \p{than} me.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex \begin{xlist}
    \ex She is as tall \p{as} I am.
    \ex Your face is (as$_{\text{\psst{Characteristic}}}$) red \p{as} a rose. (more on \p{as}-\p{as} comparatives: \cref{sec:as-as})
    \ex Your surname is the\_same \p{as} mine.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex Harry had never met anyone quite \p{like} Luna.
  \ex It was \choices{\p{as\_if}\\\p{like}} he had insulted my mother.
\end{exe}

The comparison is often made with respect to some dimension or attribute, the \psst{Characteristic}, 
which may or may not be scalar. 
The comparison may be figurative, employing simile, hyperbole, or spatial metaphor 
(\pex{close to} in the sense of `similar to'). 
The \psst{ComparisonRef} may even be a desirable or hypothetical/irrealis 
event or state (\pex{It was \p{as} it should have been}).

Prototypical prepositions include \p{than}, \p{as} (including the second item 
in the \p{as}--\p{as} construction), \p{like}, \p{unlike}. 
Prominent construals are \p{to} (\psst{Goal} for similar-thing) 
and \p{from} (\psst{Source} for dissimilar-thing).

\paragraph{\psst{Locus} construal.}
If something is preferred or appreciated \p{over} something else, \rf{ComparisonRef}{Locus} is used:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I prefer this restaurant \p{over} that one. (\rf{ComparisonRef}{Locus})\\{} 
  [paraphrase: I like this restaurant better \p{than} that one.]
\end{exe}
But for scenes of choice and substitution, see \psst{InsteadOf}.

\paragraph{\psst{Source} and \psst{Goal} construals.}
Resemblance and equivalence may be expressed with \p{to}, 
while difference may be expressed with \p{from}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\rf{ComparisonRef}{Goal}:\begin{xlist}
    \ex Shall I compare thee \p{to} a summer's day?
    \ex Her height is \choices{equal\\close} \p{to} mine.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex\rf{ComparisonRef}{Source}:\begin{xlist}
    \ex We need to distinguish what is achievable \p{from} what is desirable.
    \ex Her height is different \p{from} mine.\footnote{American English. Interestingly, 
    \emph{different \p{to}} occurs in British English.}
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\paragraph{Sufficiency and excess.}
When there is a semantics of sufficiency, as with \emph{enough}, or excess, 
as with \emph{too}, the construal \rf{ComparisonRef}{Purpose} is used for the consequence: 
see discussion at \psst{Purpose}.

\paragraph{Category as standard.} 
An indirect comparison can be made by relating something to a category 
to which it may or may not belong. \jh{edit} That is, the ``basket player'' in the following example stands as the standard given which ``he'' is deemed short. The category stands for its members 
or prototypes:
\begin{exe}
  \ex He is short \p{for} a basketball player. (\psst{ComparisonRef})
\end{exe}

\jh{Ah, I think Category as standard discussion should come first. That one's simpler to understand than the purpose construal one. }

\paragraph{Category exemplars and set members.} 
When governed by an NP naming a category or set, \p{like} is ambiguous 
between exemplifying a member, as in \cref{ex:likeSetMember} and \cref{ex:likeCatMember}, 
and merely indicating similarity, as in \cref{ex:likeSetSimilar} and \cref{ex:likeCatSimilar}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Colbert frequently promotes comedians \p{like} himself.
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex\label{ex:likeSetSimilar} [\emph{Exclusive/restrictive reading:} \emph{similar to} himself (but not including himself)]
        (\psst{ComparisonRef})
      \ex\label{ex:likeSetMember} [\emph{Inclusive/nonrestrictive reading:} \emph{such as}/\emph{including} himself (he promotes himself, among others)]
        (\rf{Part/Portion}{ComparisonRef})
    \end{xlist}
  \ex 
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex\label{ex:likeCatSimilar} I don't know anyone else \p{like} her. [anyone else \emph{similar to} her]\\ (\psst{ComparisonRef})
      \ex\label{ex:likeCatMember} It must be great to have a wonderful doctor \p{like} \choices{her\\she is}.\\ {}
      [It must be great to have her because she is a wonderful doctor]\\ (\rf{Identity}{ComparisonRef})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\hierBdef{RateUnit}

\shortdef{Unit of measure in a rate expression.}

The prototypical preposition in \p{per}:

\begin{exe} \ex \begin{xlist}
  \ex The cost is \$10 \p{per} item.
  \ex A fuel efficiency of 40 miles \p{per} gallon (of gas)
\end{xlist}\end{exe}

Paraphrase: The adposition can be paraphrased as ``for each/every''.

\begin{history}
  In v1, this fell under \sst{Value}.
\end{history}

\hierBdef{Quantity}

\shortdef{Something measured by a quantity denoted by the governor.}

The governor may be a precise or vague count/measurement. 
This includes nouns like ``lack'', ``dearth'', ``shortage'', ``excess'', or ``surplus''
(meaning a too-small or too-large amount).

Question test: the governor answers ``How much/many of (object)?''

The main preposition is \p{of}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple \psst{Quantity}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:bottleQuantity}	Pour me a bottle('s worth) \p{of} beer. [but see \cref{ex:bottleStuff}]
  \ex	I have 2 years \p{of} training.
  \ex	\begin{xlist}
    \ex I ate \choices{6 ounces\\a piece} \p{of} cake.
    \ex	An ounce \p{of} compassion
  \end{xlist}
  \ex	There's a dearth \p{of} cake in the house.
  \ex	This cake has thousands \p{of} sprinkles.
  \ex They number in the tens \p{of} thousands.
  \ex	\begin{xlist}
    \ex\label{ex:anumber} I have a \choices{number\\handful} \p{of} students.
    \ex	I have a lot \p{of} students.
    \ex	We did a lot \p{of} traveling.
    \ex	There is a lot \p{of} wet sand on the beach.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex	A pair \p{of} shoes
\end{exe}

\item If the measure includes a word like ``amount'', ``quantity'', or ``number'',\footnote{Excluding 
the expression ``a number'' meaning `several', as in \cref{ex:anumber}.} 
the construal \rf{Quantity}{Gestalt} is used 
(because the amount of something can be viewed as an attribute):
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:QuantityGestalt} \rf{Quantity}{Gestalt}:
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex	A generous amount \p{of} time
    \ex A large number \p{of} students
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
But if ``amount'', ``quantity'', etc. is used without a measure as its modifier, 
it is simply \psst{Gestalt}: see \cref{ex:amountGestalt}.

\item If the governor is a \textbf{collective noun}, 
the construal \rf{Quantity}{Stuff} is used 
(note that a ``consisting of'' paraphrase is possible):
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:QuantityStuff} \rf{Quantity}{Stuff}:
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex Can you outrun a herd \p{of} wildebeest?
    \ex Put 3 bales \p{of} hay on the truck.
    \ex	\choices{A group\\2 groups\\A throng} \p{of} vacationers just arrived.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\item Otherwise, if the object refers to \textbf{a specific item or set}, 
and the quantity measures a portion of that item 
(whether a quantifier, absolute measure, or fractional measure),
the construal \rf{Quantity}{Whole} is used:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:QuantityWhole} \rf{Quantity}{Whole}:
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex	I ate 6 ounces \p{of} the cake in the refrigerator.
    \ex	I ate \choices{half\\50\%} \p{of} the cake.
    \ex	\choices{All/many/lots/a lot/\\some/few/both/none} \p{of} the town's residents 
    are students.
    \ex	I have seen all \p{of} the city. (= the whole city)
    \ex	A lot \p{of} the sand on the beach is wet.
    \ex	2 \p{of} the children are redheads.
    \ex 2 \p{of} the 10 children in the class are redheads.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
However, simple \psst{Whole} is used if the portion is specified as 
``the rest'', ``the remainder'', etc., as in \cref{ex:rest}. %\nss{Reconsidering this: see \cref{ex:rest}}\ab{I see "half of it", "remainder of it" do have some shared meaning. Why the three "5 ounces of it", "half of it" and "remainder of it" seem different is that in the 1st case, the quantity of the proportion itself is specified, for the 2nd case, it is unspecified but can be determined from knowledge about the quantity of the whole thing and in the 3rd case, it is unspecified and cannot be %determined from knowing the quantity of the whole thing only, you also need to know how much has already been removed.}
\end{itemize}

\hierCdef{Approximator}

\shortdef{An ``operator'' that semantically takes a measurement, 
quantity, or range as an argument and ``transforms'' it in some way 
into a new measurement, quantity, or range.}

For instance:
\begin{exe}
  \ex We have \p{about} 3 eggs left.
  \ex We have \p{in\_the\_vicinity\_of} 3 eggs left.
  \ex We have \p{over} 3 eggs left.
  \ex We have \p{between} 3 and 6 eggs left.
\end{exe}
Similarly for \p{around}, \p{under}, \p{more\_than}, \p{less\_than}, \p{greater\_than}, 
\p{fewer\_than}, \p{at\_least}, and \p{at\_most}.\footnote{These constructions are 
markedly different from most PPs; it is even questionable whether these usages 
should count as prepositions. Without getting into the details here, 
even if their syntactic status is in doubt, 
we deem it practical to assign them with a semantic label in our inventory because they 
overlap lexically with ``true'' prepositions.}

\hierBdef{SocialRel}

\shortdef{Entity, such as an institution or another individual, 
with which an individual has a stable affiliation.}

Typically, \psst{SocialRel} applies directly to interpersonal relations.
It does not have any prototypical adpositions. 
Construals include:
\begin{exe}

Note, however, that \emph{work \p{with}} is ambiguous between 
being in an established professional relationship \cref{ex:workwithSR}, 
and engaging temporarily in a joint productive activity:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:workwithCA} I was working \p{with} Michael after lunch. (\psst{Co-Agent})
\end{exe}
It is up to annotators to decide from context which interpretation 
better fits the context.

\begin{history}
  Renamed from v1 label \sst{ProfessionalAspect}, which was borrowed from 
  \citet{srikumar-13,srikumar-13-inventory}.
  The name \psst{SocialRel} reflects
  a broader set of stative relations involving an individual 
  in a social context, including kinship and friendship.
  See also note under \psst{OrgRole}.
\end{history}

\hierCdef{OrgRole}

\shortdef{Organization or institution with which an individual 
has a stable affiliation, such as membership or a business relationship.}

Like its supertype \psst{SocialRel}, \psst{OrgRole} 
lacks any prototypical adposition, but participates in numerous construals:

\begin{exe}
  \ex \rf{OrgRole}{Gestalt}:
  {\setlength\multicolsep{0pt}%
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex the chairman \p{of} the board
      \ex the president \p{of} France
      \ex \choices{employees\\customers} \p{of} Grunnings
      
      \sn the board\p{'s} chairman
      \sn France\p{'s} president
      \sn Grunnings\p{'s} \choices{employees\\customers}
    \end{xlist}
  \end{multicols}}
  \ex Mr. Dursley works \p{for} Grunnings. (\rf{OrgRole}{Beneficiary})
  \ex Mr. Dursley works \p{at} Grunnings. (\rf{OrgRole}{Locus})
  \ex Mr. Dursley is \p{from} Grunnings. (\rf{OrgRole}{Source})
  \ex Mr. Dursley is \p{with} Grunnings. (\rf{OrgRole}{Accompanier})
  \ex Mr. Dursley is employed \p{by} Grunnings. (\rf{OrgRole}{Agent}) %\nss{or do we say `employ' is just a regular Agent/Theme verb?}
  \ex I bank \p{with} TSB. (\rf{OrgRole}{Accompanier})
  \ex I serve \p{on} the committee. (\rf{OrgRole}{Locus})
\end{exe}

A family counts as an institution 
construed as a \psst{Whole} (set of its members) 
or as a \psst{Locus}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I am the baby \p{of} the family. (\rf{OrgRole}{Whole})
  \ex people \p{in} my family (\rf{OrgRole}{Locus})
\end{exe}

For a relation between a unit and a larger institution, 
use \psst{Whole}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex the Principals Committee \p{of} the National Security Council (\psst{Whole})
\end{exe}

\begin{history}
  \psst{OrgRole} is now distinguished within the broader \psst{SocialRel} category 
  following the precedent of the Abstract Meaning Representation \citep[AMR;][]{amr,amr-guidelines}. 
  In AMR, \texttt{have-org-role-91} captures relations between 
  an individual and an institution (such as an organization or family),
  whereas \texttt{have-rel-role-91} is used for relations between two individuals.
\end{history}


\section{Special Constructions}\label{sec:cxns}

This section discusses notable constructions that are not limited to a single supersense.

\subsection{Genitives/Possessives}

\nss{briefly define of-genitive, s-genitive, say they are sometimes but not always interchangable, give examples with different supersenses}

%\subsubsection{Construct State Genitive in Hebrew}

\subsection{Comparatives and Superlatives}

Various constructions express a comparison between two arguments. 
When the second argument (the point of reference) 
is adpositionally marked, \psst{ComparisonRef} is used, regardless of 
its complement's syntactic type: 
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist} 
        \ex Your face is as red \p{as} \choices{a rose\\mine is}. (\psst{ComparisonRef})
        \ex Your face is redder \p{than} \choices{a rose\\mine is}. (\psst{ComparisonRef})
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
See further examples at \psst{ComparisonRef}.

\subsubsection{\p{As}-\p{as} comparative construction}\label{sec:as-as}

In an \p{as}-\p{as} comparison, the scene role of the first argument 
(the object of the first \p{as}) is the role that would be operative 
if the construction were removed and only the first argument remained: 
e.g., \pex{I stayed as long as I could} $\rightarrow$ \pex{I stayed long}.
The function of the first \p{as} is always \psst{Identity}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex Your face is \p{as} red as a rose. (\rf{Characteristic}{Identity})
    \ex I helped \p{as} much as I could. (\rf{Extent}{Identity})
    \ex I stayed \p{as} long as I could. (\rf{Duration}{Identity})
    \ex I helped \p{as} often as I could. (\rf{Frequency}{Identity})
    \ex I've eaten (twice) \p{as} much (food) as you. [amount of something]\\ 
    (\rf{Approximator}{Identity})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Superlatives}\label{sec:superlative}

\psst{Whole} is used for the superset or gestalt licensed by a superlative:
\begin{exe}
  \ex the youngest \p{of} the children (\psst{Whole})
\end{exe}
See more at \psst{Whole}.


\subsection{Infinitive Clauses}

\nss{TO (\psst{Purpose}, \rf{Characteristic}{Purpose} a.k.a. FN Inherent\_purpose, complement), FOR-TO}

\subsection{With Absolutes}

\nss{TODO}

\subsection{PP Idioms}

\nss{TODO}

\subsubsection{Reflexive PP Idioms}\label{sec:refl}

\paragraph{PERFORM-ACTIVITY \emph{for} oneself.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When something is done for one's own benefit rather than someone else's:
    \begin{exe}
      \ex I took a vacation \p{for} myself (\psst{Beneficiary})
    \end{exe}
  \item When something is done in a way that affords direct rather than second-hand information:
    \begin{exe}
      \ex You should try out the restaurant \p{for} yourself! (\rf{Agent}{Beneficiary})
    \end{exe}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{PERFORM-ACTIVITY \emph{by} oneself.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When something is done without accompaniment (the negation would be \emph{\p{with} others}):
    \begin{exe}
      \ex I had lunch (all) \p{by} myself [`alone'] (\psst{Accompanier}\footnote{Though \emph{myself} 
      is not literally accompanying \emph{I}, the PP as a whole describes the nature of accompaniment (or lack thereof).}) 
    \end{exe}
  \item When something is accomplished without assistance:
    \begin{exe}
      \ex I made the decision (all) \p{by} myself. (\psst{Manner})
      \ex The computer rebooted all \p{by} itself. (\psst{Manner})
    \end{exe}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{BE \emph{by} oneself.}
Alone; unaccompanied:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I am \p{by} myself right now. (\psst{Accompanier})
\end{exe}


\section{Special Labels}\label{sec:special}

For annotating data, there needs to be a way to indicate that \emph{none} 
of the adposition supersenses apply to a particular token. 

\subsection{DISCOURSE (\backtick d)}

Discourse connectives and other markers that transition between ideas 
or convey speaker attitude/hedging/emphasis/attribution but do not belong 
to propositional content. Examples include:
\p{according\_to}; \w{\p{after}\_all}, \w{\p{of}\_course}, \w{\p{by}\_the\_way}; 
\w{\p{for}\_chrissake} (interjection); 
\w{\p{above}\_all}, \w{more\_often\_than\_not}, \w{\p{to}\_boot};
\w{\p{in}\_other\_words}, \w{\p{on}\_the\_other\_hand}.

This label also covers ``additive focusing markers'' 
\citep[p.~592]{cgel} with a meaning similar to `also' or `too',
where an item is added to something already established in the discourse:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex I shot the sheriff \p{as}\_well.
    \ex They serve coffee, and tea \p{as}\_well.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
It also covers topicalization markers:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \p{As\_for} the sheriff, well, I shot 'im.
\end{exe}

\subsection{COORDINATOR (\backtick c)}

Coordinating conjunctions and similar expressions where 
the two elements in the relation are semantically on an equal footing, 
rather than in a figure/ground relationship: 
\begin{exe}
  \ex They serve coffee \p{as\_well\_as} tea. [`They serve coffee and also tea']
\end{exe}
